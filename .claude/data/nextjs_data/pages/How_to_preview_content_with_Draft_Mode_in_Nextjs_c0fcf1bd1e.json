  "content": "In the Pages documentation and the Data Fetching documentation, we talked about how to pre-render a page at build time (Static Generation) using getStaticProps and getStaticPaths.\n\nStatic Generation is useful when your pages fetch data from a headless CMS. However, it’s not ideal when you’re writing a draft on your headless CMS and want to view the draft immediately on your page. You’d want Next.js to render these pages at request time instead of build time and fetch the draft content instead of the published content. You’d want Next.js to bypass Static Generation only for this specific case.\n\nNext.js has a feature called Draft Mode which solves this problem. Here are instructions on how to use it.\n\nTake a look at the API Routes documentation first if you’re not familiar with Next.js API Routes.\n\nFirst, create the API route. It can have any name - e.g. pages/api/draft.ts\n\nIn this API route, you need to call setDraftMode on the response object.\n\nThis will set a cookie to enable draft mode. Subsequent requests containing this cookie will trigger Draft Mode changing the behavior for statically generated pages (more on this later).\n\nYou can test this manually by creating an API route like below and accessing it from your browser manually:\n\nIf you open your browser’s developer tools and visit /api/draft, you’ll notice a Set-Cookie response header with a cookie named __prerender_bypass.\n\nIn practice, you’d want to call this API route securely from your headless CMS. The specific steps will vary depending on which headless CMS you’re using, but here are some common steps you could take.\n\nThese steps assume that the headless CMS you’re using supports setting custom draft URLs. If it doesn’t, you can still use this method to secure your draft URLs, but you’ll need to construct and access the draft URL manually.\n\nFirst, you should create a secret token string using a token generator of your choice. This secret will only be known by your Next.js app and your headless CMS. This secret prevents people who don’t have access to your CMS from accessing draft URLs.\n\nSecond, if your headless CMS supports setting custom draft URLs, specify the following as the draft URL. This assumes that your draft API route is located at pages/api/draft.ts.\n\nYour headless CMS might allow you to include a variable in the draft URL so that <path> can be set dynamically based on the CMS’s data like so: &slug=/posts/{entry.fields.slug}\n\nFinally, in the draft API route:\n\nIf it succeeds, then the browser will be redirected to the path you want to view with the draft mode cookie.\n\nThe next step is to update getStaticProps to support draft mode.\n\nIf you request a page which has getStaticProps with the cookie set (via res.setDraftMode), then getStaticProps will be called at request time (instead of at build time).\n\nFurthermore, it will be called with a context object where context.draftMode will be true.\n\nWe used res.setDraftMode in the draft API route, so context.draftMode will be true.\n\nIf you’re also using getStaticPaths, then context.params will also be available.\n\nYou can update getStaticProps to fetch different data based on context.draftMode.\n\nFor example, your headless CMS might have a different API endpoint for draft posts. If so, you can modify the API endpoint URL like below:\n\nThat’s it! If you access the draft API route (with secret and slug) from your headless CMS or manually, you should now be able to see the draft content. And if you update your draft without publishing, you should be able to view the draft.\n\nSet this as the draft URL on your headless CMS or access manually, and you should be able to see the draft.\n\nBy default, the Draft Mode session ends when the browser is closed.\n\nTo clear the Draft Mode cookie manually, create an API route that calls setDraftMode({ enable: false }):\n\nThen, send a request to /api/disable-draft to invoke the API Route. If calling this route using next/link, you must pass prefetch={false} to prevent accidentally deleting the cookie on prefetch.\n\nDraft Mode works with getServerSideProps, and is available as a draftMode key in the context object.\n\nGood to know: You shouldn't set the Cache-Control header when using Draft Mode because it cannot be bypassed. Instead, we recommend using ISR.\n\nAPI Routes will have access to draftMode on the request object. For example:\n\nA new bypass cookie value will be generated each time you run next build.\n\nThis ensures that the bypass cookie can’t be guessed.\n\nGood to know: To test Draft Mode locally over HTTP, your browser will need to allow third-party cookies and local storage access.",

This secret prevents people who don’t have access to your CMS from accessing draft URLs. Second, if your headless CMS supports setting custom draft URLs, specify the following as the draft URL. This assumes that your draft API route is located at pages/api/draft.ts. Terminalhttps://<your-site>/api/draft?secret=<token>&slug=<path> <your-site> should be your deployment domain. <token> should be replaced with the secret token you generated. <path> should be the path for the page that you want to view. If you want to view /posts/foo, then you should use &slug=/posts/foo. Your headless CMS might allow you to include a variable in the draft URL so that <path> can be set dynamically based on the CMS’s data like so: &slug=/posts/{entry.fields.slug} Finally, in the draft API route: Check that the secret matches and that the slug parameter exists (if not, the request should fail). Call res.setDraftMode. Then redirect the browser to the path specified by slug. (The following example uses a 307 redirect). export default async (req, res) => { // Check the secret and next parameters // This secret should only be known to this API route and the CMS if (req.query.secret !== 'MY_SECRET_TOKEN' || !req.query.slug) { return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' }) } // Fetch the headless CMS to check if the provided `slug` exists // getPostBySlug would implement the required fetching logic to the headless CMS const post = await getPostBySlug(req.query.slug) // If the slug doesn't exist prevent draft mode from being enabled if (!post) { return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid slug' }) } // Enable Draft Mode by setting the cookie res.setDraftMode({ enable: true }) // Redirect to the path from the fetched post // We don't redirect to req.query.slug as that might lead to open redirect vulnerabilities res.redirect(post.slug) } If it succeeds, then the browser will be redirected to the path you want to view with the draft mode cookie.

If you request a page which has getStaticProps with the cookie set (via res.setDraftMode), then getStaticProps will be called at request time (instead of at build time).
