Good to know: When cacheComponents is enabled usePathname may require a Suspense boundary around it if your route has a dynamic param. If you use generateStaticParams the Suspense boundary is optional app/example-client-component.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client' import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation' export default function ExampleClientComponent() { const pathname = usePathname() return <p>Current pathname: {pathname}</p> } usePathname intentionally requires using a Client Component. It's important to note Client Components are not a de-optimization. They are an integral part of the Server Components architecture. For example, a Client Component with usePathname will be rendered into HTML on the initial page load. When navigating to a new route, this component does not need to be re-fetched. Instead, the component is downloaded once (in the client JavaScript bundle), and re-renders based on the current state. Good to know: Reading the current URL from a Server Component is not supported. This design is intentional to support layout state being preserved across page navigations. If your page is being statically pre-rendered and your app has rewrites in next.config or a Proxy file, reading the pathname with usePathname() can result in hydration mismatch errors—because the initial value comes from the server and may not match the actual browser pathname after routing. See our example for a way to mitigate this issue. Compatibility with Pages RouterIf you have components that use usePathname and they are imported into routes within the Pages Router, be aware that usePathname may return null if the router is not yet initialized. This can occur in cases such as fallback routes or during Automatic Static Optimization in the Pages Router.To enhance compatibility between routing systems, if your project contains both an app and a pages directory, Next.js will automatically adjust the return type of usePathname. Parameters const pathname = usePathname() usePathname does not take any parameters. Returns usePathname returns a string of the current URL's pathname. For example: URLReturned value/'/'/dashboard'/dashboard'/dashboard?v=2'/dashboard'/blog/hello-world'/blog/hello-world' Examples Do something in response to a route change app/example-client-component.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client' import { useEffect } from 'react' import { usePathname, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation' function ExampleClientComponent() { const pathname = usePathname() const searchParams = useSearchParams() useEffect(() => { // Do something here... }, [pathname, searchParams]) } Avoid hydration mismatch with rewrites When a page is pre-rendered, the HTML is generated for the source pathname.
