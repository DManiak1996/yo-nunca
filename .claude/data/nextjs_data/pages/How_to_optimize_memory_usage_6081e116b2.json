  "content": "As applications grow and become more feature rich, they can demand more resources when developing locally or creating production builds.\n\nLet's explore some strategies and techniques to optimize memory and address common memory issues in Next.js.\n\nApplications with a large amount of dependencies will use more memory.\n\nThe Bundle Analyzer can help you investigate large dependencies in your application that may be able to be removed to improve performance and memory usage.\n\nStarting in v15.0.0, you can add experimental.webpackMemoryOptimizations: true to your next.config.js file to change behavior in Webpack that reduces max memory usage but may increase compilation times by a slight amount.\n\nGood to know: This feature is currently experimental to test on more projects first, but it is considered to be low-risk.\n\nStarting in 14.2.0, you can run next build --experimental-debug-memory-usage to run the build in a mode where Next.js will print out information about memory usage continuously throughout the build, such as heap usage and garbage collection statistics. Heap snapshots will also be taken automatically when memory usage gets close to the configured limit.\n\nGood to know: This feature is not compatible with the Webpack build worker option which is auto-enabled unless you have custom webpack config.\n\nTo look for memory issues, you can record a heap profile from Node.js and load it in Chrome DevTools to identify potential sources of memory leaks.\n\nIn your terminal, pass the --heap-prof flag to Node.js when starting your Next.js build:\n\nAt the end of the build, a .heapprofile file will be created by Node.js.\n\nIn Chrome DevTools, you can open the Memory tab and click on the \"Load Profile\" button to visualize the file.\n\nYou can use an inspector tool to analyze the memory usage of the application.\n\nWhen running the next build or next dev command, add NODE_OPTIONS=--inspect to the beginning of the command. This will expose the inspector agent on the default port. If you wish to break before any user code starts, you can pass --inspect-brk instead. While the process is running, you can use a tool such as Chrome DevTools to connect to the debugging port to record and analyze a snapshot of the heap to see what memory is being retained.\n\nStarting in 14.2.0, you can also run next build with the --experimental-debug-memory-usage flag to make it easier to take heap snapshots.\n\nWhile running in this mode, you can send a SIGUSR2 signal to the process at any point, and the process will take a heap snapshot.\n\nThe heap snapshot will be saved to the project root of the Next.js application and can be loaded in any heap analyzer, such as Chrome DevTools, to see what memory is retained. This mode is not yet compatible with Webpack build workers.\n\nSee how to record and analyze heap snapshots for more information.\n\nThe Webpack build worker allows you to run Webpack compilations inside a separate Node.js worker which will decrease memory usage of your application during builds.\n\nThis option is enabled by default if your application does not have a custom Webpack configuration starting in v14.1.0.\n\nIf you are using an older version of Next.js or you have a custom Webpack configuration, you can enable this option by setting experimental.webpackBuildWorker: true inside your next.config.js.\n\nGood to know: This feature may not be compatible with all custom Webpack plugins.\n\nThe Webpack cache saves generated Webpack modules in memory and/or to disk to improve the speed of builds. This can help with performance, but it will also increase the memory usage of your application to store the cached data.\n\nYou can disable this behavior by adding a custom Webpack configuration to your application:\n\nTypechecking and linting may require a lot of memory, especially in large projects. However, most projects have a dedicated CI runner that already handles these tasks. When the build produces out-of-memory issues during the \"Linting and checking validity of types\" step, you can disable these task during builds:\n\nKeep in mind that this may produce faulty deploys due to type errors or linting issues. We strongly recommend only promoting builds to production after static analysis has completed. If you deploy to Vercel, you can check out the guide for staging deployments to learn how to promote builds to production after custom tasks have succeeded.\n\nGenerating source maps consumes extra memory during the build process.\n\nYou can disable source map generation by adding productionBrowserSourceMaps: false and experimental.serverSourceMaps: false to your Next.js configuration.\n\nGood to know: Some plugins may turn on source maps and may require custom configuration to disable.\n\nNext.js v14.1.3 fixed a memory issue when using the Edge runtime. Please update to this version (or later) to see if it addresses your issue.\n\nWhen the Next.js server starts, it preloads each page's JavaScript modules into memory, rather than at request time.\n\nThis optimization allows for faster response times, in exchange for a larger initial memory footprint.\n\nTo disable this optimization, set the experimental.preloadEntriesOnStart flag to false.\n\nNext.js doesn't unload these JavaScript modules, meaning that even with this optimization disabled, the memory footprint of your Next.js server will eventually be the same if all pages are eventually requested.",
