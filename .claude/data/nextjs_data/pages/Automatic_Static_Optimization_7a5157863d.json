  "title": "Automatic Static Optimization",
  "content": "Next.js automatically determines that a page is static (can be prerendered) if it has no blocking data requirements. This determination is made by the absence of getServerSideProps and getInitialProps in the page.\n\nThis feature allows Next.js to emit hybrid applications that contain both server-rendered and statically generated pages.\n\nGood to know: Statically generated pages are still reactive. Next.js will hydrate your application client-side to give it full interactivity.\n\nOne of the main benefits of this feature is that optimized pages require no server-side computation, and can be instantly streamed to the end-user from multiple CDN locations. The result is an ultra fast loading experience for your users.\n\nIf getServerSideProps or getInitialProps is present in a page, Next.js will switch to render the page on-demand, per-request (meaning Server-Side Rendering).\n\nIf the above is not the case, Next.js will statically optimize your page automatically by prerendering the page to static HTML.\n\nDuring prerendering, the router's query object will be empty since we do not have query information to provide during this phase. After hydration, Next.js will trigger an update to your application to provide the route parameters in the query object.\n\nThe cases where the query will be updated after hydration triggering another render are:\n\nTo be able to distinguish if the query is fully updated and ready for use, you can leverage the isReady field on next/router.\n\nGood to know: Parameters added with dynamic routes to a page that's using getStaticProps will always be available inside the query object.\n\nnext build will emit .html files for statically optimized pages. For example, the result for the page pages/about.js would be:\n\nAnd if you add getServerSideProps to the page, it will then be JavaScript, like so:",
