Good to know: <title> and <base> tags are automatically checked for duplicates by Next.js, so using key is not necessary for these tags. The contents of head get cleared upon unmounting the component, so make sure each page completely defines what it needs in head, without making assumptions about what other pages added. Use minimal nesting title, meta or any other elements (e.g. script) need to be contained as direct children of the Head element, or wrapped into maximum one level of <React.Fragment> or arrays—otherwise the tags won't be correctly picked up on client-side navigations. Use next/script for scripts We recommend using next/script in your component instead of manually creating a <script> in next/head.
