  "content": "Create a new Next.js app and run it locally.\n\nBefore you begin, make sure your development environment meets the following requirements:\n\nNext.js supports modern browsers with zero configuration.\n\nLearn more about browser support, including how to configure polyfills and target specific browsers.\n\nThe quickest way to create a new Next.js app is using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:\n\nOn installation, you'll see the following prompts:\n\nIf you choose to customize settings, you'll see the following prompts:\n\nAfter the prompts, create-next-app will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.\n\nTo manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:\n\nGood to know: The App Router uses React canary releases built-in, which include all the stable React 19 changes, as well as newer features being validated in frameworks. The Pages Router uses the React version you install in package.json.\n\nThen, add the following scripts to your package.json file:\n\nThese scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:\n\nTurbopack is now the default bundler. To use Webpack run next dev --webpack or next build --webpack. See the Turbopack docs for configuration details.\n\nNext.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by how you structure your files.\n\nCreate an app folder. Then, inside app, create a layout.tsx file. This file is the root layout. It's required and must contain the <html> and <body> tags.\n\nCreate a home page app/page.tsx with some initial content:\n\nBoth layout.tsx and page.tsx will be rendered when the user visits the root of your application (/).\n\nCreate a public folder at the root of your project to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside public can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (/).\n\nYou can then reference these assets using the root path (/). For example, public/profile.png can be referenced as /profile.png:\n\nMinimum TypeScript version: v5.1.0\n\nNext.js comes with built-in TypeScript support. To add TypeScript to your project, rename a file to .ts / .tsx and run next dev. Next.js will automatically install the necessary dependencies and add a tsconfig.json file with the recommended config options.\n\nNext.js includes a custom TypeScript plugin and type checker, which VSCode and other code editors can use for advanced type-checking and auto-completion.\n\nYou can enable the plugin in VS Code by:\n\nSee the TypeScript reference page for more information.\n\nNext.js supports linting with either ESLint or Biome. Choose a linter and run it directly via package.json scripts.\n\nIf your project previously used next lint, migrate your scripts to the ESLint CLI with the codemod:\n\nIf you use ESLint, create an explicit config (recommended eslint.config.mjs). ESLint supports both the legacy .eslintrc.* and the newer eslint.config.mjs formats. See the ESLint API reference for a recommended setup.\n\nGood to know: Starting with Next.js 16, next build no longer runs the linter automatically. Instead, you can run your linter through NPM scripts.\n\nSee the ESLint Plugin page for more information.\n\nNext.js has in-built support for the \"paths\" and \"baseUrl\" options of tsconfig.json and jsconfig.json files.\n\nThese options allow you to alias project directories to absolute paths, making it easier and cleaner to import modules. For example:\n\nTo configure absolute imports, add the baseUrl configuration option to your tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json file. For example:\n\nIn addition to configuring the baseUrl path, you can use the \"paths\" option to \"alias\" module paths.\n\nFor example, the following configuration maps @/components/* to components/*:\n\nEach of the \"paths\" are relative to the baseUrl location.",
