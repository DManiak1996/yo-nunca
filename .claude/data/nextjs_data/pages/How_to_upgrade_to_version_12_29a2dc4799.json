To upgrade you can run the following command in the terminal:\n\nNext.js now uses the Rust-based compiler SWC to compile JavaScript/TypeScript. This new compiler is up to 17x faster than Babel when compiling individual files and up to 5x faster Fast Refresh.\n\nNext.js provides full backward compatibility with applications that have custom Babel configuration. All transformations that Next.js handles by default like styled-jsx and tree-shaking of getStaticProps / getStaticPaths / getServerSideProps have been ported to Rust.\n\nWhen an application has a custom Babel configuration, Next.js will automatically opt-out of using SWC for compiling JavaScript/Typescript and will fall back to using Babel in the same way that it was used in Next.js 11.\n\nMany of the integrations with external libraries that currently require custom Babel transformations will be ported to Rust-based SWC transforms in the near future. These include but are not limited to:\n\nIn order to prioritize transforms that will help you adopt SWC, please provide your .babelrc on this feedback thread.\n\nYou can opt-in to replacing Terser with SWC for minifying JavaScript up to 7x faster using a flag in next.config.js:\n\nMinification using SWC is an opt-in flag to ensure it can be tested against more real-world Next.js applications before it becomes the default in Next.js 12.1. If you have feedback about minification, please leave it on this feedback thread.\n\nOn top of the Rust-based compiler we've implemented a new CSS parser based on the one used for the styled-jsx Babel transform. This new parser has improved handling of CSS and now errors when invalid CSS is used that would previously slip through and cause unexpected behavior.\n\nBecause of this change invalid CSS will throw an error during development and next build. This change only affects styled-jsx usage.\n\nnext/image now renders the <img> inside a <span> instead of <div>.\n\nIf your application has specific CSS targeting span such as .container span, upgrading to Next.js 12 might incorrectly match the wrapping element inside the <Image> component. You can avoid this by restricting the selector to a specific class such as .container span.item and updating the relevant component with that className, such as <span className=\"item\" />.\n\nIf your application has specific CSS targeting the next/image <div> tag, for example .container div, it may not match anymore. You can update the selector .container span, or preferably, add a new <div className=\"wrapper\"> wrapping the <Image> component and target that instead such as .container .wrapper.\n\nThe className prop is unchanged and will still be passed to the underlying <img> element.\n\nSee the documentation for more info.\n\nPreviously, Next.js used a server-sent events connection to receive HMR events. Next.js 12 now uses a WebSocket connection.\n\nIn some cases when proxying requests to the Next.js dev server, you will need to ensure the upgrade request is handled correctly. For example, in nginx you would need to add the following configuration:\n\nIf you are using Apache (2.x), you can add the following configuration to enable web sockets to the server. Review the port, host name and server names.\n\nFor custom servers, such as express, you may need to use app.all to ensure the request is passed correctly, for example:\n\nIf you are already using webpack 5 you can skip this section.\n\nNext.js has adopted webpack 5 as the default for compilation in Next.js 11. As communicated in the webpack 5 upgrading documentation Next.js 12 removes support for webpack 4.\n\nIf your application is still using webpack 4 using the opt-out flag, you will now see an error linking to the webpack 5 upgrading documentation.\n\nIf you do not have target in next.config.js you can skip this section.\n\nThe target option has been deprecated in favor of built-in support for tracing what dependencies are needed to run a page.\n\nDuring next build, Next.js will automatically trace each page and its dependencies to determine all of the files that are needed for deploying a production version of your application.\n\nIf you are currently using the target option set to serverless, please read the documentation on how to leverage the new output.",
