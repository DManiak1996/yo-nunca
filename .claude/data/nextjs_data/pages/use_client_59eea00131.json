      "description": "API ReferenceDirectivesuse clientCopy pageuse clientThe 'use client' directive declares an entry point for the components to be rendered on the client side and should be used when creating interactive user interfaces (UI) that require client-side JavaScript capabilities, such as state management, event handling, and access to browser APIs. This is a React feature. Good to know: You do not need to add the 'use client' directive to every file that contains Client Components. You only need to add it to the files whose components you want to render directly within Server Components. The 'use client' directive defines the client-server boundary, and the components exported from such a file serve as entry points to the client. Usage To declare an entry point for the Client Components, add the 'use client' directive at the top of the file, before any imports: app/components/counter.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client' import { useState } from 'react' export default function Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0) return ( <div> <p>Count: {count}</p> <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button> </div> ) } When using the 'use client' directive, the props of the Client Components must be serializable. This means the props need to be in a format that React can serialize when sending data from the server to the client. app/components/counter.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScript'use client' export default function Counter({ onClick /* ❌ Function is not serializable */, }) { return ( <div> <button onClick={onClick}>Increment</button> </div> ) } Nesting Client Components within Server Components Combining Server and Client Components allows you to build applications that are both performant and interactive: Server Components: Use for static content, data fetching, and SEO-friendly elements. Client Components: Use for interactive elements that require state, effects, or browser APIs. Component composition: Nest Client Components within Server Components as needed for a clear separation of server and client logic. In the following example: Header is a Server Component handling static content. Counter is a Client Component enabling interactivity within the page. app/page.tsxTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Header from './header' import Counter from './counter' // This is a Client Component export default function Page() { return ( <div> <Header /> <Counter /> </div> ) } Reference See the React documentation for more information on 'use client'.",
