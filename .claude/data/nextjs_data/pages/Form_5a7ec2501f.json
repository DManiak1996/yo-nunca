It's useful for forms that update URL search params as it reduces the boilerplate code needed to achieve the above. Basic usage: /ui/search.jsTypeScriptJavaScriptTypeScriptimport Form from 'next/form' export default function Page() { return ( <Form action=\"/search\"> {/* On submission, the input value will be appended to the URL, e.g. /search?query=abc */} <input name=\"query\" /> <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button> </Form> ) } Reference The behavior of the <Form> component depends on whether the action prop is passed a string or function. When action is a string, the <Form> behaves like a native HTML form that uses a GET method. The form data is encoded into the URL as search params, and when the form is submitted, it navigates to the specified URL. In addition, Next.js: Performs a client-side navigation instead of a full page reload when the form is submitted. This retains shared UI and client-side state. action (string) Props When action is a string, the <Form> component supports the following props:PropExampleTypeRequiredactionaction=\"/search\"string (URL or relative path)Yesreplacereplace={false}boolean-scrollscroll={true}boolean- action: The URL or path to navigate to when the form is submitted. An empty string \"\" will navigate to the same route with updated search params. replace: Replaces the current history state instead of pushing a new one to the browser's history stack. Default is false. scroll: Controls the scroll behavior during navigation. Defaults to true, this means it will scroll to the top of the new route, and maintain the scroll position for backwards and forwards navigation. Caveats onSubmit: Can be used to handle form submission logic. However, calling event.preventDefault() will override <Form> behavior such as navigating to the specified URL. method, encType, target: Are not supported as they override <Form> behavior. Similarly, formMethod, formEncType, and formTarget can be used to override the method, encType, and target props respectively, and using them will fallback to native browser behavior. If you need to use these props, use the HTML <form> element instead. <input type=\"file\">: Using this input type when the action is a string will match browser behavior by submitting the filename instead of the file object.",
