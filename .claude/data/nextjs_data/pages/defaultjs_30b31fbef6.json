During soft navigation, Next.js keeps track of the active state (subpage) for each slot. However, for hard navigations (full-page load), Next.js cannot recover the active state. In this case, a default.js file can be rendered for subpages that don't match the current URL. Consider the following folder structure. The @team slot has a settings page, but @analytics does not. When navigating to /settings, the @team slot will render the settings page while maintaining the currently active page for the @analytics slot. On refresh, Next.js will render a default.js for @analytics. If default.js doesn't exist, an error is returned for named slots (@team, @analytics, etc) and requires you to define a default.js in order to continue. If you want to preserve the old behavior of returning a 404 in these situations, you can create a default.js that contains: app/@team/default.jsimport { notFound } from 'next/navigation' export default function Default() { notFound() } Additionally, since children is an implicit slot, you also need to create a default.js file to render a fallback for children when Next.js cannot recover the active state of the parent page. If you don't create a default.js for the children slot, it will return a 404 page for the route.

You must use async/await or React's use function to access the values. In version 14 and earlier, params was a synchronous prop.
