  "content": "Next.js includes the next/babel preset to your app, which includes everything needed to compile React applications and server-side code. But if you want to extend the default Babel configs, it's also possible.\n\nTo start, you only need to define a .babelrc file (or babel.config.js) in the root directory of your project. If such a file is found, it will be considered as the source of truth, and therefore it needs to define what Next.js needs as well, which is the next/babel preset.\n\nHere's an example .babelrc file:\n\nYou can take a look at this file to learn about the presets included by next/babel.\n\nTo add presets/plugins without configuring them, you can do it this way:\n\nTo add presets/plugins with custom configuration, do it on the next/babel preset like so:\n\nTo learn more about the available options for each config, visit babel's documentation site.",
