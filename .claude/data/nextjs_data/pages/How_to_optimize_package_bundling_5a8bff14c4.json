  "content": "Bundling external packages can significantly improve the performance of your application. By default, packages imported inside Server Components and Route Handlers are automatically bundled by Next.js. This page will guide you through how to analyze and further optimize package bundling.\n\n@next/bundle-analyzer is a plugin for Next.js that helps you manage the size of your application bundles. It generates a visual report of the size of each package and their dependencies. You can use the information to remove large dependencies, split, or lazy-load your code.\n\nInstall the plugin by running the following command:\n\nThen, add the bundle analyzer's settings to your next.config.js.\n\nRun the following command to analyze your bundles:\n\nThe report will open three new tabs in your browser, which you can inspect. Periodically evaluating your application's bundles can help you maintain application performance over time.\n\nSome packages, such as icon libraries, can export hundreds of modules, which can cause performance issues in development and production.\n\nYou can optimize how these packages are imported by adding the optimizePackageImports option to your next.config.js. This option will only load the modules you actually use, while still giving you the convenience of writing import statements with many named exports.\n\nNext.js also optimizes some libraries automatically, thus they do not need to be included in the optimizePackageImports list. See the full list.\n\nSince packages imported inside Server Components and Route Handlers are automatically bundled by Next.js, you can opt specific packages out of bundling using the serverExternalPackages option in your next.config.js.\n\nNext.js includes a list of popular packages that currently are working on compatibility and automatically opt-ed out.
