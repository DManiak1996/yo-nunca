  "content": "Good to know: Since Next.js 13.5.1, Strict Mode is true by default with app router, so the above configuration is only necessary for pages. You can still disable Strict Mode by setting reactStrictMode: false.\n\nSuggested: We strongly suggest you enable Strict Mode in your Next.js application to better prepare your application for the future of React.\n\nReact's Strict Mode is a development mode only feature for highlighting potential problems in an application.
