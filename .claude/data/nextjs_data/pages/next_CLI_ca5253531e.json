This is useful for IDE autocomplete and CI type-checking of route usage.\n\nPreviously, route types were only generated during next dev or next build, which meant running tsc --noEmit directly wouldn't validate your route types. Now you can generate types independently and validate them externally:\n\nThe following options are available for the next typegen command:\n\nOutput files are written to <distDir>/types (typically: .next/dev/types or .next/types, see isolatedDevBuild):\n\nAdditionally, next typegen generates a next-env.d.ts file. We recommend adding next-env.d.ts to your .gitignore file.\n\nThe next-env.d.ts file is included into your tsconfig.json file, to make Next.js types available to your project.\n\nTo ensure next-env.d.ts is present before type-checking run next typegen. The commands next dev and next build also generate the next-env.d.ts file, but it is often undesirable to run these just to type-check, for example in CI/CD environments.\n\nGood to know: next typegen loads your Next.js config (next.config.js, next.config.mjs, or next.config.ts) using the production build phase. Ensure any required environment variables and dependencies are available so the config can load correctly.\n\nIf you encounter prerendering errors during next build, you can pass the --debug-prerender flag to get more detailed output:\n\nThis enables several experimental options to make debugging easier:\n\nThis helps surface more readable stack traces and code frames in the build output.\n\nWarning: --debug-prerender is for debugging in development only. Do not deploy builds generated with --debug-prerender to production, as it may impact performance.\n\nYou can build only specific routes in the App and Pages Routers using the --debug-build-paths option. This is useful for faster debugging when working with large applications. The --debug-build-paths option accepts comma-separated file paths and supports glob patterns:\n\nBy default, Next.js uses http://localhost:3000 during development and with next start. The default port can be changed with the -p option, like so:\n\nOr using the PORT environment variable:\n\nGood to know: PORT cannot be set in .env as booting up the HTTP server happens before any other code is initialized.\n\nFor certain use cases like webhooks or authentication, you can use HTTPS to have a secure environment on localhost. Next.js can generate a self-signed certificate with next dev using the --experimental-https flag:\n\nWith the generated certificate, the Next.js development server will exist at https://localhost:3000. The default port 3000 is used unless a port is specified with -p, --port, or PORT.\n\nYou can also provide a custom certificate and key with --experimental-https-key and --experimental-https-cert. Optionally, you can provide a custom CA certificate with --experimental-https-ca as well.\n\nnext dev --experimental-https is only intended for development and creates a locally trusted certificate with mkcert. In production, use properly issued certificates from trusted authorities.\n\nWhen deploying Next.js behind a downstream proxy (e.g. a load-balancer like AWS ELB/ALB), it's important to configure Next's underlying HTTP server with keep-alive timeouts that are larger than the downstream proxy's timeouts. Otherwise, once a keep-alive timeout is reached for a given TCP connection, Node.js will immediately terminate that connection without notifying the downstream proxy. This results in a proxy error whenever it attempts to reuse a connection that Node.js has already terminated.\n\nTo configure the timeout values for the production Next.js server, pass --keepAliveTimeout (in milliseconds) to next start, like so:\n\nYou can pass any node arguments to next commands.

This is useful for faster debugging when working with large applications. The --debug-build-paths option accepts comma-separated file paths and supports glob patterns: Terminal# Build a specific route next build --debug-build-paths=\"app/page.tsx\" # Build more than one route next build --debug-build-paths=\"app/page.tsx,pages/index.tsx\" # Use glob patterns next build --debug-build-paths=\"app/**/page.tsx\" next build --debug-build-paths=\"pages/*.tsx\" Changing the default port By default, Next.js uses http://localhost:3000 during development and with next start. The default port can be changed with the -p option, like so: Terminalnext dev -p 4000 Or using the PORT environment variable: TerminalPORT=4000 next dev Good to know: PORT cannot be set in .env as booting up the HTTP server happens before any other code is initialized. Using HTTPS during development For certain use cases like webhooks or authentication, you can use HTTPS to have a secure environment on localhost. Next.js can generate a self-signed certificate with next dev using the --experimental-https flag: Terminalnext dev --experimental-https With the generated certificate, the Next.js development server will exist at https://localhost:3000. The default port 3000 is used unless a port is specified with -p, --port, or PORT. You can also provide a custom certificate and key with --experimental-https-key and --experimental-https-cert. Optionally, you can provide a custom CA certificate with --experimental-https-ca as well. Terminalnext dev --experimental-https --experimental-https-key ./certificates/localhost-key.pem --experimental-https-cert ./certificates/localhost.pem next dev --experimental-https is only intended for development and creates a locally trusted certificate with mkcert. In production, use properly issued certificates from trusted authorities. Configuring a timeout for downstream proxies When deploying Next.js behind a downstream proxy (e.g. a load-balancer like AWS ELB/ALB), it's important to configure Next's underlying HTTP server with keep-alive timeouts that are larger than the downstream proxy's timeouts. Otherwise, once a keep-alive timeout is reached for a given TCP connection, Node.js will immediately terminate that connection without notifying the downstream proxy. This results in a proxy error whenever it attempts to reuse a connection that Node.js has already terminated. To configure the timeout values for the production Next.js server, pass --keepAliveTimeout (in milliseconds) to next start, like so: Terminalnext start --keepAliveTimeout 70000 Passing Node.js arguments You can pass any node arguments to next commands. For example: TerminalNODE_OPTIONS='--throw-deprecation' next NODE_OPTIONS='-r esm' next NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next VersionChangesv16.0.0The JS bundle size metrics have been removed from next buildv15.5.0Add the next typegen commandv15.4.0Add --debug-prerender option for next build to help debug prerender errors.",
