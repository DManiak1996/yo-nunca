  "content": "CSS Chunking is a strategy used to improve the performance of your web application by splitting and re-ordering CSS files into chunks. This allows you to load only the CSS that is needed for a specific route, instead of loading all the application's CSS at once.\n\nYou can control how CSS files are chunked using the experimental.cssChunking option in your next.config.js file:\n\nYou may consider using 'strict' if you run into unexpected CSS behavior. For example, if you import a.css and b.css in different files using a different import order (a before b, or b before a), true will merge the files in any order and assume there are no dependencies between them. However, if b.css depends on a.css, you may want to use 'strict' to prevent the files from being merged, and instead, load them in the order they are imported - which can result in more chunks and requests.\n\nFor most applications, we recommend true as it leads to fewer requests and better performance.",
