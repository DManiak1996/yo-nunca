You do not need to manually setup an Asset Prefix.\n\nGood to know: Next.js 9.5+ added support for a customizable Base Path, which is better suited for hosting your application on a sub-path like /docs. We do not suggest you use a custom Asset Prefix for this use case.\n\nTo set up a CDN, you can set up an asset prefix and configure your CDN's origin to resolve to the domain that Next.js is hosted on.\n\nOpen next.config.mjs and add the assetPrefix config based on the phase:\n\nNext.js will automatically use your asset prefix for the JavaScript and CSS files it loads from the /_next/ path (.next/static/ folder). For example, with the above configuration, the following request for a JS chunk:\n\nWould instead become:\n\nThe exact configuration for uploading your files to a given CDN will depend on your CDN of choice. The only folder you need to host on your CDN is the contents of .next/static/, which should be uploaded as _next/static/ as the above URL request indicates. Do not upload the rest of your .next/ folder, as you should not expose your server code and other configuration to the public.\n\nWhile assetPrefix covers requests to _next/static, it does not influence the following paths:",
