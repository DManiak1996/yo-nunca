  "title": "getStaticProps",
  "content": "If you export a function called getStaticProps (Static Site Generation) from a page, Next.js will pre-render this page at build time using the props returned by getStaticProps.\n\nNote that irrespective of rendering type, any props will be passed to the page component and can be viewed on the client-side in the initial HTML. This is to allow the page to be hydrated correctly. Make sure that you don't pass any sensitive information that shouldn't be available on the client in props.\n\nThe getStaticProps API reference covers all parameters and props that can be used with getStaticProps.\n\nYou should use getStaticProps if:\n\ngetStaticProps always runs on the server and never on the client. You can validate code written inside getStaticProps is removed from the client-side bundle with this tool.\n\nWhen combined with Incremental Static Regeneration, getStaticProps will run in the background while the stale page is being revalidated, and the fresh page served to the browser.\n\ngetStaticProps does not have access to the incoming request (such as query parameters or HTTP headers) as it generates static HTML. If you need access to the request for your page, consider using Proxy in addition to getStaticProps.\n\nThe following example shows how you can fetch a list of blog posts from a CMS.\n\nThe getStaticProps API reference covers all parameters and props that can be used with getStaticProps.\n\nAs getStaticProps runs only on the server-side, it will never run on the client-side. It won’t even be included in the JS bundle for the browser, so you can write direct database queries without them being sent to browsers.\n\nThis means that instead of fetching an API route from getStaticProps (that itself fetches data from an external source), you can write the server-side code directly in getStaticProps.\n\nTake the following example. An API route is used to fetch some data from a CMS. That API route is then called directly from getStaticProps. This produces an additional call, reducing performance. Instead, the logic for fetching the data from the CMS can be shared by using a lib/ directory. Then it can be shared with getStaticProps.\n\nAlternatively, if you are not using API routes to fetch data, then the fetch() API can be used directly in getStaticProps to fetch data.\n\nTo verify what Next.js eliminates from the client-side bundle, you can use the next-code-elimination tool.\n\nWhen a page with getStaticProps is pre-rendered at build time, in addition to the page HTML file, Next.js generates a JSON file holding the result of running getStaticProps.\n\nThis JSON file will be used in client-side routing through next/link or next/router. When you navigate to a page that’s pre-rendered using getStaticProps, Next.js fetches this JSON file (pre-computed at build time) and uses it as the props for the page component. This means that client-side page transitions will not call getStaticProps as only the exported JSON is used.\n\nWhen using Incremental Static Generation, getStaticProps will be executed in the background to generate the JSON needed for client-side navigation. You may see this in the form of multiple requests being made for the same page, however, this is intended and has no impact on end-user performance.\n\ngetStaticProps can only be exported from a page. You cannot export it from non-page files, _app, _document, or _error.\n\nOne of the reasons for this restriction is that React needs to have all the required data before the page is rendered.\n\nAlso, you must use export getStaticProps as a standalone function — it will not work if you add getStaticProps as a property of the page component.\n\nGood to know: if you have created a custom app, ensure you are passing the pageProps to the page component as shown in the linked document, otherwise the props will be empty.\n\nIn development (next dev), getStaticProps will be called on every request.\n\nYou can temporarily bypass static generation and render the page at request time instead of build time using Preview Mode. For example, you might be using a headless CMS and want to preview drafts before they're published.",
