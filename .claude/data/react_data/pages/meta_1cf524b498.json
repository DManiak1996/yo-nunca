  "content": "The built-in browser <meta> component lets you add metadata to the document.\n\nTo add document metadata, render the built-in browser <meta> component. You can render <meta> from any component and React will always place the corresponding DOM element in the document head.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\n<meta> supports all common element props.\n\nIt should have exactly one of the following props: name, httpEquiv, charset, itemProp. The <meta> component does something different depending on which of these props is specified.\n\nReact will always place the DOM element corresponding to the <meta> component within the document’s <head>, regardless of where in the React tree it is rendered. The <head> is the only valid place for <meta> to exist within the DOM, yet it’s convenient and keeps things composable if a component representing a specific page can render <meta> components itself.\n\nThere is one exception to this: if <meta> has an itemProp prop, there is no special behavior, because in this case it doesn’t represent metadata about the document but rather metadata about a specific part of the page.\n\nYou can annotate the document with metadata such as keywords, a summary, or the author’s name. React will place this metadata within the document <head> regardless of where in the React tree it is rendered.\n\nYou can render the <meta> component from any component. React will put a <meta> DOM node in the document <head>.\n\nYou can use the <meta> component with the itemProp prop to annotate specific items within the document with metadata. In this case, React will not place these annotations within the document <head> but will place them like any other React component.",
