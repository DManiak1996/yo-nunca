  "content": "act is a test helper to apply pending React updates before making assertions.\n\nTo prepare a component for assertions, wrap the code rendering it and performing updates inside an await act() call. This makes your test run closer to how React works in the browser.\n\nYou might find using act() directly a bit too verbose. To avoid some of the boilerplate, you could use a library like React Testing Library, whose helpers are wrapped with act().\n\nWhen writing UI tests, tasks like rendering, user events, or data fetching can be considered as “units” of interaction with a user interface. React provides a helper called act() that makes sure all updates related to these “units” have been processed and applied to the DOM before you make any assertions.\n\nThe name act comes from the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.\n\nWe recommend using act with await and an async function. Although the sync version works in many cases, it doesn’t work in all cases and due to the way React schedules updates internally, it’s difficult to predict when you can use the sync version.\n\nWe will deprecate and remove the sync version in the future.\n\nact does not return anything.\n\nWhen testing a component, you can use act to make assertions about its output.\n\nFor example, let’s say we have this Counter component, the usage examples below show how to test it:\n\nTo test the render output of a component, wrap the render inside act():\n\nHere, we create a container, append it to the document, and render the Counter component inside act(). This ensures that the component is rendered and its effects are applied before making assertions.\n\nUsing act ensures that all updates have been applied before we make assertions.\n\nTo test events, wrap the event dispatch inside act():\n\nHere, we render the component with act, and then dispatch the event inside another act(). This ensures that all updates from the event are applied before making assertions.\n\nDon’t forget that dispatching DOM events only works when the DOM container is added to the document. You can use a library like React Testing Library to reduce the boilerplate code.\n\nUsing act requires setting global.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT=true in your test environment. This is to ensure that act is only used in the correct environment.\n\nIf you don’t set the global, you will see an error like this:\n\nTo fix, add this to your global setup file for React tests:\n\nIn testing frameworks like React Testing Library, IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT is already set for you.",
