See the alternatives.\n\nrenderToString renders a React tree to an HTML string.\n\nOn the server, call renderToString to render your app to HTML.\n\nOn the client, call hydrateRoot to make the server-generated HTML interactive.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nreactNode: A React node you want to render to HTML. For example, a JSX node like <App />.\n\noptional options: An object for server render.\n\nrenderToString has limited Suspense support. If a component suspends, renderToString immediately sends its fallback as HTML.\n\nrenderToString works in the browser, but using it in the client code is not recommended.\n\nCall renderToString to render your app to an HTML string which you can send with your server response:\n\nThis will produce the initial non-interactive HTML output of your React components. On the client, you will need to call hydrateRoot to hydrate that server-generated HTML and make it interactive.\n\nrenderToString does not support streaming or waiting for data. See the alternatives.\n\nrenderToString returns a string immediately, so it does not support streaming content as it loads.\n\nWhen possible, we recommend using these fully-featured alternatives:\n\nYou can continue using renderToString if your server environment does not support streams.\n\nrenderToString returns a string immediately, so it does not support waiting for data to load for static HTML generation.\n\nWe recommend using these fully-featured alternatives:\n\nYou can continue using renderToString if your static site generation environment does not support streams.\n\nSometimes, renderToString is used on the client to convert some component to HTML.\n\nImporting react-dom/server on the client unnecessarily increases your bundle size and should be avoided. If you need to render some component to HTML in the browser, use createRoot and read HTML from the DOM:\n\nThe flushSync call is necessary so that the DOM is updated before reading its innerHTML property.\n\nrenderToString does not fully support Suspense.\n\nIf some component suspends (for example, because it’s defined with lazy or fetches data), renderToString will not wait for its content to resolve. Instead, renderToString will find the closest <Suspense> boundary above it and render its fallback prop in the HTML. The content will not appear until the client code loads.\n\nTo solve this, use one of the recommended streaming solutions. For server side rendering, they can stream content in chunks as it resolves on the server so that the user sees the page being progressively filled in before the client code loads. For static site generation, they can wait for all the content to resolve before generating the static HTML.",
