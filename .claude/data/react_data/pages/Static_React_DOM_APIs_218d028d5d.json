  "content": "The react-dom/static APIs let you generate static HTML for React components. They have limited functionality compared to the streaming APIs. A framework may call them for you. Most of your components don’t need to import or use them.\n\nThese methods are only available in the environments with Web Streams, which includes browsers, Deno, and some modern edge runtimes:\n\nNode.js also includes these methods for compatibility, but they are not recommended due to worse performance. Use the dedicated Node.js APIs instead.\n\nThese methods are only available in the environments with Node.js Streams:",
