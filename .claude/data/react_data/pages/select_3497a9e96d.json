  "content": "The built-in browser <select> component lets you render a select box with options.\n\nTo display a select box, render the built-in browser <select> component.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\n<select> supports all common element props.\n\nYou can make a select box controlled by passing a value prop:\n\nWhen you pass value, you must also pass an onChange handler that updates the passed value.\n\nIf your <select> is uncontrolled, you may pass the defaultValue prop instead:\n\nThese <select> props are relevant both for uncontrolled and controlled select boxes:\n\nRender a <select> with a list of <option> components inside to display a select box. Give each <option> a value representing the data to be submitted with the form.\n\nTypically, you will place every <select> inside a <label> tag. This tells the browser that this label is associated with that select box. When the user clicks the label, the browser will automatically focus the select box. It’s also essential for accessibility: a screen reader will announce the label caption when the user focuses the select box.\n\nIf you can’t nest <select> into a <label>, associate them by passing the same ID to <select id> and <label htmlFor>. To avoid conflicts between multiple instances of one component, generate such an ID with useId.\n\nBy default, the browser will select the first <option> in the list. To select a different option by default, pass that <option>’s value as the defaultValue to the <select> element.\n\nUnlike in HTML, passing a selected attribute to an individual <option> is not supported.\n\nPass multiple={true} to the <select> to let the user select multiple options. In that case, if you also specify defaultValue to choose the initially selected options, it must be an array.\n\nAdd a <form> around your select box with a <button type=\"submit\"> inside. It will call your <form onSubmit> event handler. By default, the browser will send the form data to the current URL and refresh the page. You can override that behavior by calling e.preventDefault(). Read the form data with new FormData(e.target).\n\nGive a name to your <select>, for example <select name=\"selectedFruit\" />. The name you specified will be used as a key in the form data, for example { selectedFruit: \"orange\" }.\n\nIf you use <select multiple={true}>, the FormData you’ll read from the form will include each selected value as a separate name-value pair. Look closely at the console logs in the example above.\n\nBy default, any <button> inside a <form> will submit it. This can be surprising! If you have your own custom Button React component, consider returning <button type=\"button\"> instead of <button>. Then, to be explicit, use <button type=\"submit\"> for buttons that are supposed to submit the form.\n\nA select box like <select /> is uncontrolled. Even if you pass an initially selected value like <select defaultValue=\"orange\" />, your JSX only specifies the initial value, not the value right now.\n\nTo render a controlled select box, pass the value prop to it. React will force the select box to always have the value you passed. Typically, you will control a select box by declaring a state variable:\n\nThis is useful if you want to re-render some part of the UI in response to every selection.\n\nIf you pass value without onChange, it will be impossible to select an option. When you control a select box by passing some value to it, you force it to always have the value you passed. So if you pass a state variable as a value but forget to update that state variable synchronously during the onChange event handler, React will revert the select box after every keystroke back to the value that you specified.\n\nUnlike in HTML, passing a selected attribute to an individual <option> is not supported.",
