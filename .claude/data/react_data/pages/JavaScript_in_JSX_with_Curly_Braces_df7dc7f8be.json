  "title": "JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces",
  "content": "JSX lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file, keeping rendering logic and content in the same place. Sometimes you will want to add a little JavaScript logic or reference a dynamic property inside that markup. In this situation, you can use curly braces in your JSX to open a window to JavaScript.\n\nWhen you want to pass a string attribute to JSX, you put it in single or double quotes:\n\nHere, \"https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg\" and \"Gregorio Y. Zara\" are being passed as strings.\n\nBut what if you want to dynamically specify the src or alt text? You could use a value from JavaScript by replacing \" and \" with { and }:\n\nNotice the difference between className=\"avatar\", which specifies an \"avatar\" CSS class name that makes the image round, and src={avatar} that reads the value of the JavaScript variable called avatar. That’s because curly braces let you work with JavaScript right there in your markup!\n\nJSX is a special way of writing JavaScript. That means it’s possible to use JavaScript inside it—with curly braces { }. The example below first declares a name for the scientist, name, then embeds it with curly braces inside the <h1>:\n\nTry changing the name’s value from 'Gregorio Y. Zara' to 'Hedy Lamarr'. See how the list title changes?\n\nAny JavaScript expression will work between curly braces, including function calls like formatDate():\n\nYou can only use curly braces in two ways inside JSX:\n\nIn addition to strings, numbers, and other JavaScript expressions, you can even pass objects in JSX. Objects are also denoted with curly braces, like { name: \"Hedy Lamarr\", inventions: 5 }. Therefore, to pass a JS object in JSX, you must wrap the object in another pair of curly braces: person={{ name: \"Hedy Lamarr\", inventions: 5 }}.\n\nYou may see this with inline CSS styles in JSX. React does not require you to use inline styles (CSS classes work great for most cases). But when you need an inline style, you pass an object to the style attribute:\n\nTry changing the values of backgroundColor and color.\n\nYou can really see the JavaScript object inside the curly braces when you write it like this:\n\nThe next time you see {{ and }} in JSX, know that it’s nothing more than an object inside the JSX curlies!\n\nInline style properties are written in camelCase. For example, HTML <ul style=\"background-color: black\"> would be written as <ul style={{ backgroundColor: 'black' }}> in your component.\n\nYou can move several expressions into one object, and reference them in your JSX inside curly braces:\n\nIn this example, the person JavaScript object contains a name string and a theme object:\n\nThe component can use these values from person like so:\n\nJSX is very minimal as a templating language because it lets you organize data and logic using JavaScript.\n\nNow you know almost everything about JSX:\n\nThis code crashes with an error saying Objects are not valid as a React child:\n\nCan you find the problem?",
