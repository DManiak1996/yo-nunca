  "content": "useFormStatus is a Hook that gives you status information of the last form submission.\n\nThe useFormStatus Hook provides status information of the last form submission.\n\nTo get status information, the Submit component must be rendered within a <form>. The Hook returns information like the pending property which tells you if the form is actively submitting.\n\nIn the above example, Submit uses this information to disable <button> presses while the form is submitting.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nuseFormStatus does not take any parameters.\n\nA status object with the following properties:\n\npending: A boolean. If true, this means the parent <form> is pending submission. Otherwise, false.\n\ndata: An object implementing the FormData interface that contains the data the parent <form> is submitting. If there is no active submission or no parent <form>, it will be null.\n\nmethod: A string value of either 'get' or 'post'. This represents whether the parent <form> is submitting with either a GET or POST HTTP method. By default, a <form> will use the GET method and can be specified by the method property.\n\nTo display a pending state while a form is submitting, you can call the useFormStatus Hook in a component rendered in a <form> and read the pending property returned.\n\nHere, we use the pending property to indicate the form is submitting.\n\nThe useFormStatus Hook only returns status information for a parent <form> and not for any <form> rendered in the same component calling the Hook, or child components.\n\nInstead call useFormStatus from inside a component that is located inside <form>.\n\nYou can use the data property of the status information returned from useFormStatus to display what data is being submitted by the user.\n\nHere, we have a form where users can request a username. We can use useFormStatus to display a temporary status message confirming what username they have requested.\n\nuseFormStatus will only return status information for a parent <form>.\n\nIf the component that calls useFormStatus is not nested in a <form>, status.pending will always return false. Verify useFormStatus is called in a component that is a child of a <form> element.\n\nuseFormStatus will not track the status of a <form> rendered in the same component. See Pitfall for more details.",
