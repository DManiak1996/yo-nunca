  "content": "This API will be removed in a future major version of React.\n\nIn React 18, hydrate was replaced by hydrateRoot. Using hydrate in React 18 will warn that your app will behave as if it’s running React 17. Learn more here.\n\nhydrate lets you display React components inside a browser DOM node whose HTML content was previously generated by react-dom/server in React 17 and below.\n\nCall hydrate in React 17 and below to “attach” React to existing HTML that was already rendered by React in a server environment.\n\nReact will attach to the HTML that exists inside the domNode, and take over managing the DOM inside it. An app fully built with React will usually only have one hydrate call with its root component.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nreactNode: The “React node” used to render the existing HTML. This will usually be a piece of JSX like <App /> which was rendered with a ReactDOM Server method such as renderToString(<App />) in React 17.\n\ndomNode: A DOM element that was rendered as the root element on the server.\n\noptional: callback: A function. If passed, React will call it after your component is hydrated.\n\nhydrate returns null.\n\nCall hydrate to attach a React component into a server-rendered browser DOM node.\n\nUsing hydrate() to render a client-only app (an app without server-rendered HTML) is not supported. Use render() (in React 17 and below) or createRoot() (in React 18+) instead.\n\nIn React, “hydration” is how React “attaches” to existing HTML that was already rendered by React in a server environment. During hydration, React will attempt to attach event listeners to the existing markup and take over rendering the app on the client.\n\nIn apps fully built with React, you will usually only hydrate one “root”, once at startup for your entire app.\n\nUsually you shouldn’t need to call hydrate again or to call it in more places. From this point on, React will be managing the DOM of your application. To update the UI, your components will use state.\n\nFor more information on hydration, see the docs for hydrateRoot.\n\nIf a single element’s attribute or text content is unavoidably different between the server and the client (for example, a timestamp), you may silence the hydration mismatch warning.\n\nTo silence hydration warnings on an element, add suppressHydrationWarning={true}:\n\nThis only works one level deep, and is intended to be an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it. Unless it’s text content, React still won’t attempt to patch it up, so it may remain inconsistent until future updates.\n\nIf you intentionally need to render something different on the server and the client, you can do a two-pass rendering. Components that render something different on the client can read a state variable like isClient, which you can set to true in an Effect:\n\nThis way the initial render pass will render the same content as the server, avoiding mismatches, but an additional pass will happen synchronously right after hydration.\n\nThis approach makes hydration slower because your components have to render twice. Be mindful of the user experience on slow connections. The JavaScript code may load significantly later than the initial HTML render, so rendering a different UI immediately after hydration may feel jarring to the user.",
