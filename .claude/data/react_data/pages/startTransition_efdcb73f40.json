  "content": "startTransition lets you render a part of the UI in the background.\n\nThe startTransition function lets you mark a state update as a Transition.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nstartTransition does not return anything.\n\nstartTransition does not provide a way to track whether a Transition is pending. To show a pending indicator while the Transition is ongoing, you need useTransition instead.\n\nYou can wrap an update into a Transition only if you have access to the set function of that state. If you want to start a Transition in response to some prop or a custom Hook return value, try useDeferredValue instead.\n\nThe function you pass to startTransition is called immediately, marking all state updates that happen while it executes as Transitions. If you try to perform state updates in a setTimeout, for example, they won’t be marked as Transitions.\n\nYou must wrap any state updates after any async requests in another startTransition to mark them as Transitions. This is a known limitation that we will fix in the future (see Troubleshooting).\n\nA state update marked as a Transition will be interrupted by other state updates. For example, if you update a chart component inside a Transition, but then start typing into an input while the chart is in the middle of a re-render, React will restart the rendering work on the chart component after handling the input state update.\n\nTransition updates can’t be used to control text inputs.\n\nIf there are multiple ongoing Transitions, React currently batches them together. This is a limitation that may be removed in a future release.\n\nYou can mark a state update as a Transition by wrapping it in a startTransition call:\n\nTransitions let you keep the user interface updates responsive even on slow devices.\n\nWith a Transition, your UI stays responsive in the middle of a re-render. For example, if the user clicks a tab but then change their mind and click another tab, they can do that without waiting for the first re-render to finish.\n\nstartTransition is very similar to useTransition, except that it does not provide the isPending flag to track whether a Transition is ongoing. You can call startTransition when useTransition is not available. For example, startTransition works outside components, such as from a data library.\n\nLearn about Transitions and see examples on the useTransition page.",
