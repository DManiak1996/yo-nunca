Refer to the instructions in the [Webex Registering your Integration documentation](https://developer.webex.com/docs/integrations#registering-your-integration) to begin.\n\nn8n recommends using the following **Scopes** for your integration:\n\n- `spark:rooms_read`\n- `spark:messages_write`\n- `spark:messages_read`\n- `spark:memberships_read`\n- `spark:memberships_write`\n- `meeting:recordings_write`\n- `meeting:recordings_read`\n- `meeting:preferences_read`\n- `meeting:schedules_write`\n- `meeting:schedules_read`",
