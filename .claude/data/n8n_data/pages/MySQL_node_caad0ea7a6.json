When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).\n\n- Delete\n- Execute SQL\n- Insert\n- Insert or Update\n- Select\n- Update\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Generate SQL queries from schema only - AI-powered**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2508-generate-sql-queries-from-schema-only-ai-powered/)\n\n**Generate Monthly Financial Reports with Gemini AI, SQL, and Outlook**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/3617-generate-monthly-financial-reports-with-gemini-ai-sql-and-outlook/)\n\n**Import CSV into MySQL**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1839-import-csv-into-mysql/)\n\n[Browse MySQL integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/mysql/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [MySQL's Connectors and APIs documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-connectors.html) for more information about the service.\n\nRefer to MySQL's [SELECT statement documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/select.html) for more information on writing SQL queries.\n\n## Use query parameters\n\nWhen creating a query to run on a MySQL database, you can use the **Query Parameters** field in the **Options** section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.\n\nFor example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:\n\nYou can write a query like:\n\nThen in **Query Parameters**, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:\n\nFor common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common issues](common-issues/).",
