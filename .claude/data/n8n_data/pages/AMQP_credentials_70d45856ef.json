  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [AMQP Sender](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.amqp/)\n- [AMQP Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.amqptrigger/)\n\nInstall an AMQP 1.0-compatible message broker like [ActiveMQ](https://activemq.apache.org/). Refer to [AMQP Products](https://www.amqp.org/about/examples) for a list of options.\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\nAdvanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware. The defining features of AMQP are message orientation, queuing, routing, reliability and security. Refer to the [OASIS AMQP Version 1.0 Standard](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-overview-v1.0.html) for more information.\n\nRefer to your provider's documentation for more information about the service. Refer to [ActiveMQ's API documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/components/classic/documentation/rest) as one example.\n\n## Using AMQP connection\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- A **Hostname**: Enter the hostname of your AMQP message broker.\n- A **Port**: Enter the port number the connection should use.\n- A **User**: Enter the name of the user to establish the connection as.\n  - For example, the default username in ActiveMQ is `admin`.\n- A **Password**: Enter the user's password.\n  - For example, the default password in ActiveMQ is `admin`.\n- *Optional:* **Transport Type**: Enter either `tcp` or `tls`.\n\nRefer to your provider's documentation for more detailed instructions.",
