  "content": "User management in n8n allows you to invite people to work in your n8n instance.\n\nThis document describes how to configure your n8n instance to support user management, and the steps to start inviting users.\n\nRefer to the main [User management](../../../user-management/) guide for more information about usage, including:\n\n- [Managing users](../../../user-management/manage-users/)\n- [Account types](../../../user-management/account-types/)\n- [Best practices](../../../user-management/best-practices/)\n\nFor LDAP setup information, refer to [LDAP](../../../user-management/ldap/).\n\nFor SAML setup information, refer to [SAML](../../../user-management/saml/).\n\nBasic auth and JWT removed\n\nn8n removed support for basic auth and JWT in version 1.0.\n\nThere are three stages to set up user management in n8n:\n\n1. Configure your n8n instance to use your SMTP server.\n1. Start n8n and follow the setup steps in the app.\n1. Invite users.\n\nn8n recommends setting up an SMTP server, for user invites and password resets.\n\nOptional from 0.210.1\n\nFrom version 0.210.1 onward, this step is optional. You can choose to manually copy and send invite links instead of setting up SMTP. Note that if you skip this step, users can't reset passwords.\n\nGet the following information from your SMTP provider:\n\n- Server name\n- SMTP username\n- SMTP password\n- SMTP sender name\n\nTo set up SMTP with n8n, configure the SMTP environment variables for your n8n instance. For information on how to set environment variables, refer to [Configuration](../configuration-methods/)\n\n| Variable                                    | Type    | Description                                                                                                                  | Required? |\n| ------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |\n| `N8N_EMAIL_MODE`                            | string  | `smtp`                                                                                                                       | Required  |\n| `N8N_SMTP_HOST`                             | string  | *your_SMTP_server_name*                                                                                                      | Required  |\n| `N8N_SMTP_PORT`                             | number  | *your_SMTP_server_port* Default is `465`.                                                                                    | Optional  |\n| `N8N_SMTP_USER`                             | string  | *your_SMTP_username*                                                                                                         | Optional  |\n| `N8N_SMTP_PASS`                             | string  | *your_SMTP_password*                                                                                                         | Optional  |\n| `N8N_SMTP_OAUTH_SERVICE_CLIENT`             | string  | *your_OAuth_service_client*                                                                                                  | Optional  |\n| `N8N_SMTP_OAUTH_PRIVATE_KEY`                | string  | *your_OAuth_private_key*                                                                                                     | Optional  |\n| `N8N_SMTP_SENDER`                           | string  | Sender email address.

Refer to [Environment variables](../environment-variables/) for a list. These include options to disable tags, workflow templates, and the personalization survey, if you don't want your users to see them.\n\nIf you're not familiar with SMTP, this [blog post by SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/blog/what-is-an-smtp-server/) offers a short introduction, while [Wikipedia's Simple Mail Transfer Protocol article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) provides more detailed technical background.\n\n### Step two: In-app setup\n\nWhen you set up user management for the first time, you create an owner account.\n\n1. Open n8n. The app displays a signup screen.\n1. Enter your details. Your password must be at least eight characters, including at least one number and one capital letter.\n1. Click **Next**. n8n logs you in with your new owner account.\n\n### Step three: Invite users\n\nYou can now invite other people to your n8n instance.\n\n1. Sign into your workspace with your owner account. (If you are in the Admin Panel open your **Workspace** from the Dashboard)\n1. Click the three dots next to your user icon at the bottom left and click **Settings**. n8n opens your **Personal settings** page.\n1. Click **Users** to go to the **Users** page.\n1. Click **Invite**.\n1. Enter the new user's email address.\n1. Click **Invite user**. n8n sends an email with a link for the new user to join.",
