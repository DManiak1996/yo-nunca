  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [Snowflake](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.snowflake/)\n\nCreate a [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) account.\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\n- Database connection\n\nRefer to [Snowflake's API documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/api-reference) and [SQL Command Reference](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference-commands) for more information about the service.\n\n## Using database connection\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- An **Account** name: Your account name is the string of characters located between `https://` and `snowflakecomputing.com` in your Snowflake URL. For example, if the URL of your Snowflake account is `https://abc.eu-central-1.snowflakecomputing.com` then the name of your account is `abc.eu-central-1`.\n- A **Database**: Enter the name of the [database](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/use-database) the credential should connect to.\n- A **Warehouse**: Enter the name of the default virtual [warehouse](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/use-warehouse) to use for the session after connecting. n8n uses this warehouse for performing queries, loading data, and so on.\n- A **Username**\n- A **Password**\n- A **Schema**: Enter the [schema](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/use-schema) you want to use after connecting.\n- A **Role**: Enter the security [role](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/use-role) you want to use after connecting.\n- **Client Session Keep Alive**: By default, client connections typically time out three or four hours after the most recent query execution. Turning this setting on sets the `clientSessionKeepAlive` parameter to true: the server will keep the client's connection alive indefinitely, even if the connection doesn't execute any queries.\n\nRefer to [Session Commands](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/commands-session) for more information on these settings.",
