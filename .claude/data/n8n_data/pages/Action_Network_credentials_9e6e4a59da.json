Log in to your Action Network account.\n1. From the **Start Organizing** menu, select **Details >** [**API & Sync**](https://actionnetwork.org/apis).\n1.

If you're already a paying customer, [contact them](https://actionnetwork.org/contact) to request partner access. Partner access includes API key access.\n1. If you're a developer, [request a developer account](https://actionnetwork.org/developers). Once your account request is granted, you'll have API key access.",
