  "content": "For security reasons, you may want to block your users from accessing or working with specific n8n nodes. This is helpful if your users might be untrustworthy.\n\nUse the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable to prevent your users from accessing specific nodes.\n\nUpdate your `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable to include an array of strings containing any nodes you want to block your users from using.\n\nFor example, setting the variable this way:\n\nBlocks the [Execute Command](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/) and [Read/Write Files from Disk](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) nodes.\n\nYour n8n users won't be able to search for or use these nodes.\n\n## Suggested nodes to block\n\nThe nodes that can pose security risks vary based on your use case and user profile. Here are some nodes you might want to start with:\n\n- [Execute Command](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/)\n- [Read/Write Files from Disk](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)\n\nRefer to [Nodes environment variables](../../configuration/environment-variables/nodes/) for more information on this environment variable.\n\nRefer to [Configuration](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on setting environment variables.",
