  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [Wise](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wise/)\n- [Wise Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wisetrigger/)\n\nCreate a [Wise](https://wise.com/) account.\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\nRefer to [Wise's API documentation](https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/api-reference) for more information about the service.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- An **API Token**: Go to your **user menu > Settings > API tokens** to generate an API token. Enter the generated API key in your n8n credential. Refer to [Getting started with the API](https://wise.com/help/articles/2958107/getting-started-with-the-api) for more information.\n- Your **Environment**: Select the environment that best matches your Wise account environment.\n  - If you're using a Wise test sandbox account, select **Test**.\n  - Otherwise, select **Live**.\n- **Private Key (Optional)**: For live endpoints requiring Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), generate a public and private key. Enter the private key here. Refer to [Add a private key](#add-a-private-key) for more information.\n  - If you're using a **Test** environment, you'll only need to enter a Private Key if you've enabled Strong Customer Authentication on the [public keys management page](https://sandbox.transferwise.tech/public-keys).\n\nWise protects some live endpoints and operations with Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). Refer to [Strong Customer Authentication & 2FA](https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/features/strong-customer-authentication-2fa) for details.\n\nIf you make a request to an endpoint that requires SCA, Wise returns a 403 Forbidden HTTP status code. The error returned will look like this:\n\n> This request requires Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). Please add a key pair to your account and n8n credentials. See https://api-docs.transferwise.com/#strong-customer-authentication-personal-token\n\nTo use endpoints requiring SCA, generate an RSA key pair and add the relevant key information to both Wise and n8n:\n\n1. Generate an RSA key pair:\n\n1. Add the content of the public key `public.pem` to your Wise **user menu > Settings > API tokens > Manage public keys**.\n\n1. Add the content of the private key `private.pem` in n8n to the **Private Key (Optional)**.\n\nRefer to [Personal Token SCA](https://docs.wise.com/api-docs/guides/strong-customer-authentication-2fa/personal-token-sca) for more information.",
