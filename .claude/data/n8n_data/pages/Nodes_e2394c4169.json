  "content": "[Nodes](../../../glossary/#node-n8n) are the key building blocks of a [workflow](../../../glossary/#workflow-n8n). They perform a range of actions, including:\n\n- Starting the workflow.\n- Fetching and sending data.\n- Processing and manipulating data.\n\nn8n provides a collection of built-in nodes, as well as the ability to create your own nodes. Refer to:\n\n- [Built-in integrations](../../../integrations/builtin/node-types/) to browse the node library.\n- [Community nodes](../../../integrations/community-nodes/installation/) for guidance on finding and installing community-created nodes.\n- [Creating nodes](../../../integrations/creating-nodes/overview/) to start building your own nodes.\n\n## Add a node to your workflow\n\n### Add a node to an empty workflow\n\n1. Select **Add first step**. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse [trigger nodes](../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n).\n\n1. Select the trigger you want to use.\n\nChoose the correct app event\n\nIf you select **On App Event**, n8n shows a list of all the supported services. Use this list to browse n8n's integrations and trigger a workflow in response to an event in your chosen service. Not all integrations have triggers. To see which ones you can use as a trigger, select the node. If a trigger is available, you'll see it at the top of the available operations list.\n\nFor example, this is the trigger for Asana:\n\n### Add a node to an existing workflow\n\nSelect the **Add node** connector. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse all nodes.\n\n## Node operations: Triggers and Actions\n\nWhen you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.\n\nThere are two types of operation:\n\n- Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon .\n- Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected.\n\nTo view node controls, hover over the node on the canvas:\n\n- **Execute step** : Run the node.\n- **Deactivate** : Deactivate the node.\n- **Delete** : Delete the node.\n- **Node context menu** : Select node actions. Available actions:\n  - Open node\n  - Execute step\n  - Rename node\n  - Deactivate node\n  - Pin node\n  - Copy node\n  - Duplicate node\n  - Tidy up workflow\n  - Convert node to sub-workflow\n  - Select all\n  - Clear selection\n  - Delete node\n\nThe node settings under the **Settings** tab allow you to control node behaviors and add node notes.\n\nWhen active or set, they do the following:\n\n- **Always Output Data**: The node returns an empty item even if the node returns no data during execution. Be careful setting this on IF nodes, as it could cause an infinite loop.\n- **Execute Once**: The node executes once, with data from the first item it receives. It doesn't process any extra items.\n- **Retry On Fail**: When an execution fails, the node reruns until it succeeds.\n- **On Error**:\n  - **Stop Workflow**: Halts the entire workflow when an error occurs, preventing further node execution.\n  - **Continue**: Proceeds to the next node despite the error, using the last valid data.\n  - **Continue (using error output)**: Continues workflow execution, passing error information to the next node for potential handling.\n\nYou can document your workflow using node notes:\n\n- **Notes**: Note to save with the node.\n- **Display note in flow**: If active, n8n displays the note in the workflow as a subtitle.",
