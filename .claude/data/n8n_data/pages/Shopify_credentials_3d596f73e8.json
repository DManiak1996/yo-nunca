  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes with Shopify.\n\n- [Shopify](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.shopify/)\n- [Shopify Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.shopifytrigger/)\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\n- Access token (recommended): For private apps/single store use. Can be created by regular admins.\n- OAuth2: For public apps. Must be created by partner accounts.\n- API key: Deprecated.\n\nRefer to [Shopify's authentication documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/auth) for more information about the service.\n\n## Using access token\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need a [Shopify](https://shopify.com/) admin account and:\n\n- Your **Shop Subdomain**\n- An **Access Token**: Generated when you create a custom app.\n- An **APP Secret Key**: Generated when you create a custom app.\n\nTo set up the credential, you'll need to create and install a custom app:\n\n1. Enter your **Shop Subdomain**.\n\n- Your subdomain is within the URL: `https://<subdomain>.myshopify.com`. For example, if the full URL is `https://n8n.myshopify.com`, the Shop Subdomain is `n8n`.\n\n1. In Shopify, go to **Admin > Settings >** [**Apps and sales channels**](https://admin.shopify.com/settings/apps).\n\n1. Select **Develop apps**.\n\n1. Select **Create a custom app**.\n\nDon't see this option?\n\nIf you don't see this option, your store probably doesn't have custom app development enabled. Refer to [Enable custom app development](#enable-custom-app-development) for more information.\n\n1. In the modal window, enter the **App name**.\n\n1. Select an **App developer**. The app developer can be the store owner or any account with the **Develop apps** permission.\n\n1. Select **Create app**.\n\n1. Select **Select scopes**. In the **Admin API access scopes** section, select the API scopes you want for your app.\n\n- To use all functionality in the [Shopify](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.shopify/) node, add the `read_orders`, `write_orders`, `read_products`, and `write_products` scopes.\n   - Refer to [Shopify API Access Scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes) for more information on the available scopes.\n\n1. Select **Install app**.\n\n1. In the modal window, select **Install app**.\n\n1. Open the app's **API Credentials** section.\n\n1. Copy the **Admin API Access Token**. Enter this in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**.\n\n1. Copy the **API Secret Key**. Enter this in your n8n credential as the **APP Secret Key**.\n\nRefer to [Creating a custom app](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/app-types/custom-apps) and [Generate access tokens for custom apps in the Shopify admin](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/access-token-types/generate-app-access-tokens-admin) for more information on these steps.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need a [Shopify partner](https://www.shopify.com/partners) account and:\n\n- A **Client ID**: Generated when you create a custom app.\n- A **Client Secret**: Generated when you create a custom app.\n- Your **Shop Subdomain**\n\nTo set up the credential, you'll need to create and install a custom app:\n\nCustom app development\n\nShopify provides templates for creating new apps. The instructions below only cover the elements necessary to set up your n8n credential. Refer to Shopify's [Build dev docs](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build) for more information on building apps and working with app templates.\n\n1. Open your [Shopify Partner dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com/).\n1. Select **Apps** from the left navigation.\n1. Select **Create app**.\n1. In the **Use Shopify Partners** section, enter an **App name**.\n1. Select **Create app**.\n1. When the app details open, copy the **Client ID**. Enter this in your n8n credential.\n1. Copy the **Client Secret**. Enter this in your n8n credential.\n1. In the left menu, select **Configuration**.\n1. In n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and paste it into the **Allowed redirection URL(s)** in the **URLs** section.\n1. In the **URLs** section, enter an **App URL** for your app. The host entered here needs to match the host for the **Allowed redirection URL(s)**, like the base URL for your n8n instance.\n1. Select **Save and release**.\n1. Select **Overview** from the left menu. At this point, you can choose to **Test your app** by installing it to one of your stores, or **Choose distribution** to distribute it publicly.\n1. In n8n, enter the **Shop Subdomain** of the store you installed the app to, either as a test or as a distribution.\n   - Your subdomain is within the URL: `https://<subdomain>.myshopify.com`. For example, if the full URL is `https://n8n.myshopify.com`, the Shop Subdomain is `n8n`.\n\nShopify no longer generates API keys with passwords. Use the [Access token](#using-access-token) method instead.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- An **API Key**\n- A **Password**\n- Your **Shop Subdomain**: Your subdomain is within the URL: `https://<subdomain>.myshopify.com`. For example, if the full URL is `https://n8n.myshopify.com`, the Shop Subdomain is `n8n`.\n- *Optional:* A **Shared Secret**\n\nHere are some common issues setting up the Shopify credential and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.\n\n### Enable custom app development\n\nIf you don't see the option to **Create a custom app**, no one's enabled custom app development for your store.\n\nTo enable custom app development, you must log in either as a store owner or as a user with the **Enable app development** permission:\n\n1. In Shopify, go to **Admin > Settings >** [**Apps and sales channels**](https://admin.shopify.com/settings/apps).\n1. Select **Develop apps**.\n1. Select **Allow custom app development**.\n1. Read the warning and information provided and select **Allow custom app development**.\n\n### Forbidden credentials error\n\nIf you get a **Couldn't connect with these settings / Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials** warning when you test the credentials, this may be due to your app's [access scope](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes) dependencies. For example, the `read_orders` scope also requires `read_products` scope. Review the scopes you have assigned and the action you're trying to complete.",
