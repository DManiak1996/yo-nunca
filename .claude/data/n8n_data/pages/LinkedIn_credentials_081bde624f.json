Check the box to agree to the **Legal agreement**.\n1. Select **Create app**.\n1. This should open the **Products** tab.

Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.\n\nAll users must select:\n\n- **Organization Support**: If turned on, the credential requests permission to post as an organization using the `w_organization_social` scope.\n  - To use this option, you must put your app through LinkedIn's [Community Management App Review](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/community-management-app-review) process.\n- **Legacy**: If turned on, the credential uses legacy scopes for `r_liteprofile` and `r_emailaddress` instead of the newer `profile` and `email` scopes.\n\nIf you're [self-hosting](../../../../hosting/) n8n, you'll need to configure OAuth2 from scratch by creating a new developer app:\n\n1.
