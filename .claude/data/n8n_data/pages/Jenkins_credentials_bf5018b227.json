Refer to those detailed pages for more information about the service. Refer to [Jenkins Remote Access API](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/remote-access-api/) for information on the API and API wrappers.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- The **Jenkins Username**: For the user whom the token belongs to\n- A **Personal API Token**: Generate this from the user's **profile details > Configure > Add new token**. Refer to [these Stack Overflow instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45466090/how-to-get-the-api-token-for-jenkins) for more detail.\n- The **Jenkins Instance URL**\n\nJenkins rebuilt their API token setup in 2018. If you're working with an older Jenkins instance, be sure you're using a non-legacy API token. Refer to [Security Hardening: New API token system in Jenkins 2.129+](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2018/07/02/new-api-token-system/) for more information.",
