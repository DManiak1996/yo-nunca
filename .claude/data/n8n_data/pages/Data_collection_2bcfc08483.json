Use the instructions below to opt out of data telemetry collection.\n\nRefer to [Privacy | Data collection in self-hosted n8n](../../../privacy-security/privacy/#data-collection-in-self-hosted-n8n) for details on the data n8n collects.\n\n## How collection works\n\nYour n8n instance sends most data to n8n as the events that generate it occur. Workflow execution counts and an instance pulse are sent periodically (every 6 hours). These data types mostly fall into n8n telemetry collection.\n\n## Opting out of data collection\n\nn8n enables telemetry collection by default. To disable it, configure the following environment variables.\n\n### Opt out of telemetry events\n\nTo opt out of telemetry events, set the `N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED` environment variable to false, for example:\n\n### Opt out of checking for new versions of n8n\n\nTo opt out of checking for new versions of n8n, set the `N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED` environment variable to false, for example:\n\n## Disable all connection to n8n servers\n\nIf you want to fully prevent all communication with n8n's servers, refer to [Isolate n8n](../../configuration/configuration-examples/isolation/).\n\nRefer to [Deployment environment variables](../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) for more information on these environment variables.\n\nRefer to [Configuration](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on setting environment variables.",
