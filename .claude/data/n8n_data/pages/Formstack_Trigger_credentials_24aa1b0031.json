For example `https://localhost:5678/rest/oauth2-credential/callback`.\n  - **Platform**: Select **Website**.\n\nOnce you've created the application, copy the access token either from the applications list or by selecting the application to view its details.\n\nRefer to [Formstack's API Authorization documentation](https://developers.formstack.com/reference/api-overview#obtaining-an-api-key-oauth2-access-token) for more detailed instructions.\n\nAccess token permissions\n\nFormstack ties access tokens to a Formstack user.
