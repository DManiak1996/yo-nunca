Refer to [Creating an account](https://matrix.org/docs/chat_basics/matrix-for-im/#creating-a-matrix-account) for more information.\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\nRefer to the [Matrix Specification](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/) for more information about the service.\n\nRefer to the documentation for the specific client you're using to access the Matrix server.\n\n## Using API access token\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- An **Access Token**: This token is tied to the account you use to log into Matrix with.\n- A **Homeserver URL**: This is the URL of the [homeserver](https://matrix.org/docs/matrix-concepts/elements-of-matrix/#homeserver) you entered when you created your account. n8n prepopulates this with matrix.org's own server; adjust this if you're using a server hosted elsewhere.\n\nInstructions for getting these details vary depending on the client you're using to access the server. Both the **Access Token** and the **Homeserver URL** can most commonly be found in **Settings > Help & About > Advanced**, but refer to your client's documentation for more details.",
