  "content": "Use this operation to create, update, clear or delete a sheet in a Google spreadsheet from Google Sheets. Refer to [Google Sheets](../) for more information on the Google Sheets node itself.\n\nThis node can be used as an AI tool\n\nThis node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](../../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).\n\n## Append or Update Row\n\nUse this operation to update an existing row or add a new row at the end of the data if a matching entry isn't found in a sheet.\n\nEnter these parameters:\n\n- **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [Google Sheets credentials](../../../credentials/google/).\n- **Resource**: Select **Sheet Within Document**.\n- **Operation**: Select **Append or Update Row**.\n- **Document**: Choose a spreadsheet that contains the sheet you want to append or update row(s) to.\n  - Select **From list** to choose the spreadsheet title from the dropdown list, **By URL** to enter the url of the spreadsheet, or **By ID** to enter the `spreadsheetId`.\n  - You can find the `spreadsheetId` in a Google Sheets URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/spreadsheetId/edit#gid=0`.\n- **Sheet**: Choose a sheet you want to append or update row(s) to.\n  - Select **From list** to choose the sheet title from the dropdown list, **By URL** to enter the url of the sheet, **By ID** to enter the `sheetId`, or **By Name** to enter the sheet title.\n  - You can find the `sheetId` in a Google Sheets URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/aBC-123_xYz/edit#gid=sheetId`.\n- **Mapping Column Mode**:\n  - **Map Each Column Manually**: Enter **Values to Send** for each column.\n  - **Map Automatically**: n8n looks for incoming data that matches the columns in Google Sheets automatically. In this mode, make sure the incoming data fields are the same as the columns in Google Sheets. (Use an [Edit Fields](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node before this node to change them if required.)\n  - **Nothing**: Don't map any data.\n\n- **Cell Format**: Use this option to choose how to format the data in cells. Refer to [Google Sheets API | CellFormat](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/cells#CellFormat) for more information.\n  - **Let Google Sheets format** (default): n8n formats text and numbers in the cells according to Google Sheets' default settings.\n  - **Let n8n format**: New cells in your sheet will have the same data types as the input data provided by n8n.\n- **Data Location on Sheet**: Use this option when you need to specify the data range on your sheet.\n  - **Header Row**: Specify the row index that contains the column headers.\n  - **First Data Row**: Specify the row index where the actual data starts.\n- **Handling extra fields in input**: When using **Mapping Column Mode > Map Automatically**, use this option to decide how to handle fields in the input data that don't match any existing columns in the sheet.\n  - **Insert in New Column(s)** (default): Adds new columns for any extra data.\n  - **Ignore Them**: Ignores extra data that don't match the existing columns.\n  - **Error**: Throws an error and stops execution.\n- **Use Append**: Turn on this option to use the [Google API append endpoint](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/values#append_values) for adding new data rows.\n  - By default, n8n appends empty rows or columns and then adds the new data. This approach can ensure data alignment but may be less efficient. Using the append endpoint can lead to better performance by minimizing the number of API calls and simplifying the process. But if the existing sheet data has inconsistencies such as gaps or breaks between rows and columns, n8n may add the new data in the wrong place, leading to misalignment issues.\n  - Use this option when performance is a priority and the data structure in the sheet is consistent without gaps.\n\nRefer to the [Method: spreadsheets.values.update | Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets.values/update) API documentation for more information.\n\nUse this operation to append a new row at the end of the data in a sheet.\n\nEnter these parameters:\n\n- **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [Google Sheets credentials](../../../credentials/google/).\n- **Resource**: Select **Sheet Within Document**.\n- **Operation**: Select **Append Row**.\n- **Document**: Choose a spreadsheet with the sheet you want to append a row to.\n  - Select **From list** to choose the spreadsheet title from the dropdown list, **By URL** to enter the url of the spreadsheet, or **By ID** to enter the `spreadsheetId`.\n  - You can find the `spreadsheetId` in a Google Sheets URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/spreadsheetId/edit#gid=0`.\n- **Sheet**: Choose a sheet you want to append a row to.\n  - Select **From list** to choose the sheet title from the dropdown list, **By URL** to enter the url of the sheet, **By ID** to enter the `sheetId`, or **By Name** to enter the sheet title.\n  - You can find the `sheetId` in a Google Sheets URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/aBC-123_xYz/edit#gid=sheetId`.\n- **Mapping Column Mode**:\n  - **Map Each Column Manually**: Select the **Column to Match On** when finding the rows to update. Enter **Values to Send** for each column.\n  - **Map Automatically**: n8n looks for incoming data that matches the columns in Google Sheets automatically. In this mode, make sure the incoming data fields are the same as the columns in Google Sheets. (Use an [Edit Fields](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node before this node to change them if required.)\n  - **Nothing**: Don't map any data.\n\n- **Cell Format**: Use this option to choose how to format the data in cells.

Data type remains as number.\n  - **Values (formatted)**: n8n displays the values as they appear in Google Sheets (for example, retaining commas or currency signs) by converting the data type from number to string.\n  - **Formulas**: n8n returns the formula. It doesn't calculate the formula output. For example, if a cell B2 has the formula `=A2`, n8n returns B2's value as `=A2` (in text).

By default only the first result gets returned.\n\nn8n treats the first row in a Google Sheet as a heading row, and doesn't return it when reading all rows. If you want to read the first row, use the **Options** to set **Data Location on Sheet**.\n\nRefer to the [Method: spreadsheets.batchUpdate | Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/batchUpdate) API documentation for more information.\n\nUse this operation to update existing row in a sheet. This operation only updates existing rows.
