  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [OracleDB](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.oracledb/)\n- [Agent](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/)\n\nThese nodes do not support SSH tunnels. They require Oracle Database 19c or later. For thick mode, use Oracle Client Libraries 19c or later.\n\nCreate a user account on a [OracleDB](https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=GUID-F0246961-558F-480B-AC0F-14B50134621C) server database.\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\n- Database connection\n\nRefer to [Oracle Database documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database) for more information about the service.\n\n## Using database connection\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- A **User** name.\n- A **Password** for that user.\n- **Connection String**: The Oracle database instance to connect to. The string can be an Easy Connect string, or a TNS Alias from a tnsnames.ora file, or the Oracle database instance.\n- **Use Optional Oracle Client Libraries**: If you want to use node-oracledb Thick mode for working with Oracle Database advanced features, turn this on. This option is not available in official n8n docker images. Additional settings to enable Thick mode are required. Refer to [Enabling Thick mode documentation](https://node-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/initialization.html#enabling-node-oracledb-thick-mode) for more information.\n- **Use SSL**: If your Connection String is using SSL, turn this on and configure additional details for the SSL Authentication.\n- **Wallet Password**: The password to decrypt the Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)-encoded private certificate, if it is encrypted.\n- **Wallet Content**: The security credentials required to establish a mutual TLS (mTLS) connection to Oracle Database.\n- **Distinguished Name**: The distinguished name (DN) that should be matched with the certificate DN.\n- **Match Distinguished Name**: Whether the server certificate DN should be matched in addition to the regular certificate verification that is performed.\n- **Allow Weak Distinguished Name Match**: Whether the secure DN matching behavior which checks both the listener and server certificates has to be performed.\n- **Pool Min**: The number of connections established to the database when a pool is created.\n- **Pool Max**: The maximum number of connections to which a connection pool can grow.\n- **Pool Increment**: The number of connections that are opened whenever a connection request exceeds the number of currently open connections.\n- **Pool Maximum Session Life Time**: The number of connections that are opened whenever a connection request exceeds the number of currently open connections.\n- **Pool Connection Idle Timeout**: The number of connections that are opened whenever a connection request exceeds the number of currently open connections.\n- **Connection Class Name**: DRCP/PRCP Connection Class. Refer to [Enabling DRCP](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/admin/managing-processes.html#GUID-BB76E57C-3F16-4C85-AEF6-BA14FC1B4777) for more information.\n- **Connection Timeout**: The timeout duration in seconds for an application to establish an Oracle Net connection.\n- **Transport Connection Timeout**: The maximum number of seconds to wait to establish a connection to the database host.\n- **Keepalive Probe Interval**: The number of minutes between the sending of keepalive probes.\n\nTo set up your database connection credential:\n\n1. Enter your database's username as the **User** in your n8n credential.\n\n1. Enter the user's **Password**.\n\n1. Enter your database's connection string as the **Connection String** in your n8n credential.\n\n1. If your database uses SSL and you'd like to configure **SSL** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. If you turn it on, enter the information of your Oracle Database SSL certificate in these fields:\n\n1. Enter the output of PEM-encoded wallet file, **ewallet.pem** contents after retaining the new lines. The command\n\ncan be used to dump file contents in the **Wallet Content** field.\n\nRefer to [node-oracledb](https://node-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/connection_handling.html#mutual-tls-connections-to-oracle-cloud-autonomous-database) for more information on working with TLS connections.",
