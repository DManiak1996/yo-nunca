  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [Azure Storage](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.azurestorage/)\n\n- Create an [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) subscription.\n- Create an [Azure storage account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create).\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\n- OAuth2\n- Shared Key\n\nRefer to [Azure Storage's API documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/) for more information about the service.\n\nNote for n8n Cloud users\n\nCloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.\n\nFor self-hosted users, there are two main steps to configure OAuth2 from scratch:\n\n1. [Register an application](#register-an-application) with the Microsoft Identity Platform.\n1. [Generate a client secret](#generate-a-client-secret) for that application.\n\nFollow the detailed instructions for each step below. For more detail on the Microsoft OAuth2 web flow, refer to [Microsoft authentication and authorization basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts).\n\n### Register an application\n\nRegister an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform:\n\n1. Open the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://aka.ms/appregistrations).\n1. Select **Register an application**.\n1. Enter a **Name** for your app.\n1. In **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Skype, Xbox)**.\n1. In **Register an application**:\n   1. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from your n8n credential.\n   1. Paste it into the **Redirect URI (optional)** field.\n   1. Select **Select a platform** > **Web**.\n1. Select **Register** to finish creating your application.\n1. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and paste it into n8n as the **Client ID**.\n\nRefer to [Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2) for more information.\n\n### Generate a client secret\n\nWith your application created, generate a client secret for it:\n\n1. On your Microsoft application page, select **Certificates & secrets** in the left navigation.\n1. In **Client secrets**, select **+ New client secret**.\n1. Enter a **Description** for your client secret, such as `n8n credential`.\n1. Select **Add**.\n1. Copy the **Secret** in the **Value** column.\n1. Paste it into n8n as the **Client Secret**.\n1. Select **Connect my account** in n8n to finish setting up the connection.\n1. Log in to your Microsoft account and allow the app to access your info.\n\nRefer to Microsoft's [Add credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#add-credentials) for more information on adding a client secret.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- An **Account**: The name of your Azure Storage account.\n- A **Key**: A shared key for your Azure Storage account. Select **Security + networking** and then **Access keys**. You can use either of the two account keys for this purpose.\n\nRefer to [Manage storage account access keys | Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage) for more detailed steps.\n\nHere are the known common errors and issues with Azure Storage credentials.\n\n### Need admin approval\n\nWhen attempting to add credentials for a Microsoft360 or Microsoft Entra account, users may see a message when following the procedure that this action requires admin approval.\n\nThis message will appear when the account attempting to grant permissions for the credential is managed by a Microsoft Entra. In order to issue the credential, the administrator account needs to grant permission to the user (or \"tenant\") for that application.\n\nThe procedure for this is covered in the [Microsoft Entra documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/grant-admin-consent).",
