Select **Add Embeds** to set extra fields including Description, Author, Title, URL, and URL Image.\n\nTo add fields that aren't included by default, set **Input Method** to **Raw JSON**. From here, add a JSON object to the **Value** parameter defining the [field names](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/message#embed-object) and values you want to include.\n\nFor example, to include `footer` and `fields`, neither of which are available using the **Enter Fields** Input Method, you could use a JSON object like this:\n\nYou can learn more about embeds in [Using Webhooks and Embeds | Discord](https://discord.com/safety/using-webhooks-and-embeds).\n\nIf you experience issues when working with embeds with the Discord node, you can use the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) with your existing Discord credentials to `POST` to the following URL:\n\nIn the body, include your embed information in the message content like this:\n\n## Mention users and channels\n\nTo mention users and channels in Discord messages, you need to format your message according to [Discord's message formatting guidelines](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#message-formatting).\n\nTo mention a user, you need to know the Discord user's user ID. Keep in mind that the user ID is different from the user's display name. Similarly, you need a channel ID to link to a specific channel.\n\nYou can learn how to enable developer mode and copy the user or channel IDs in [Discord's documentation on finding User/Server/Message IDs](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID).\n\nOnce you have the user or channel ID, you can format your message with the following syntax:\n\n- **User**: `<@USER_ID>`\n- **Channel**: `<#CHANNEL_ID>`\n- **Role**: `<@&ROLE_ID>`",
