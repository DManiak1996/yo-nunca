  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [Kafka](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.kafka/)\n- [Kafka Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.kafkatrigger/)\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\nRefer to [Kafka's documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/) for more information about using the service.\n\nIf you're new to Kafka, refer to the [Apache Kafka Quickstart](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) for initial setup.\n\nRefer to [Encryption and Authentication using SSL](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_ssl) for working with SSL in Kafka.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need a running Kafka environment and:\n\n- A **Client ID**\n- A list of relevant **Brokers**\n- Username/password authentication details if your Kafka environment uses authentication\n\n1. Enter the `CLIENT-ID` of the client or consumer group in the **Client ID** field in your credential.\n1. Enter a comma-separated list of relevant **Brokers** for the credential to use in the format `<broker-service-name>:<port>`. Use the name you gave the broker when you defined it in the `services` list. For example, `kafka-1:9092,kafka-2:9092` would add the brokers `kafka-1` and `kafka-2` on port `9092`.\n1. If your Kafka environment doesn't use SSL, turn off the **SSL** toggle.\n1. If you've enabled authentication using SASL in your Kafka environment, turn on the **Authentication** toggle. Then add:\n   1. The **Username**\n   1. The **Password**\n   1. Select the broker's configured **SASL Mechanism**. Refer to [SASL configuration](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_sasl_config) for more information. Options include:\n      - `Plain`\n      - `scram-sha-256`\n      - `scram-sha-512`",
