You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n- **Model**: Select the model to use to generate the embedding.\n\nLearn more about available models in [Mistral's models documentation](https://docs.mistral.ai/platform/pricing/).\n\n- **Batch Size**: Enter the maximum number of documents to send in each request.\n- **Strip New Lines**: Select whether to remove new line characters from input text (turned on) or not (turned off). n8n enables this by default.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Breakdown Documents into Study Notes using Templating MistralAI and Qdrant**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2339-breakdown-documents-into-study-notes-using-templating-mistralai-and-qdrant/)\n\n**Build a Financial Documents Assistant using Qdrant and Mistral.ai**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2335-build-a-financial-documents-assistant-using-qdrant-and-mistralai/)\n\n**Build a Tax Code Assistant with Qdrant, Mistral.ai and OpenAI**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2341-build-a-tax-code-assistant-with-qdrant-mistralai-and-openai/)\n\n[Browse Embeddings Mistral Cloud integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/embeddings-mistral-cloud/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [Langchain's Mistral embeddings documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/text_embedding/mistralai) for more information about the service.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
