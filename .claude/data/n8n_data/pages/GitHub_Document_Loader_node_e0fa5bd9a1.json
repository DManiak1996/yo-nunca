This node doesn't support OAuth for authentication.\n\nParameter resolution in sub-nodes\n\nSub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.\n\nMost nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n- **Text Splitting**: Choose from:\n  - **Simple**: Uses the [Recursive Character Text Splitter](../n8n-nodes-langchain.textsplitterrecursivecharactertextsplitter/) with a chunk size of 1000 and an overlap of 200.\n  - **Custom**: Allows you to connect a text splitter of your choice.\n- **Repository Link**: Enter the URL of your GitHub repository.\n- **Branch**: Enter the branch name to use.\n\n- **Recursive**: Select whether to include sub-folders and files (turned on) or not (turned off).\n- **Ignore Paths**: Enter directories to ignore.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n[Browse GitHub Document Loader integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/github-document-loader/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [LangChain's documentation on document loaders](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/integrations/file_loaders/) for more information about the service.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
