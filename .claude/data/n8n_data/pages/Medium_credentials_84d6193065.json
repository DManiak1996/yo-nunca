These credentials still appear within n8n, but you can't configure new integrations using them.\n\n- Create an account on [Medium](https://www.medium.com/).\n- For OAuth2, request access to credentials by emailing [yourfriends@medium.com](mailto:yourfriends@medium.com).\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\n- API access token\n- OAuth2\n\nRefer to [Medium's API documentation](https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs) for more information about the service.\n\n## Using API access token\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- An API **Access Token**: Generate a token in **Settings >** [**Security and apps**](https://medium.com/me/settings/security) **> Integration tokens**. Use the integration token this generates as your n8n **Access Token**.\n\nRefer to the Medium API [Self-issued access tokens documentation](https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs?tab=readme-ov-file#21-self-issued-access-tokens) for more information.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- A **Client ID**\n- A **Client Secret**\n\nTo generate a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, you'll need access to the **Developers** menu.
