Facebook Lead Ads will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.\n\nTo work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:\n\nHalts production traffic\n\nThis workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.\n\n1. Go to your workflow page.\n1. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.\n1. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.\n1. When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.",
