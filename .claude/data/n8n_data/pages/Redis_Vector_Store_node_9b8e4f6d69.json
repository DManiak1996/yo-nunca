  "content": "Use the Redis Vector Store node to interact with your Redis database as a [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store). You can insert documents into the vector database, get documents from the vector database, retrieve documents using a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain), or connect it directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to use as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool).\n\nOn this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Redis Vector Store node, and links to more resources.\n\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/redis/).\n\nParameter resolution in sub-nodes\n\nSub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.\n\nMost nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\nBefore using this node, you need a Redis database with the [Redis Query Engine](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/ai/search-and-query/?utm_source=n8n&utm_medium=docs) enabled. Use one of the following:\n\n- Redis Open Source (v8.0 and later) - includes the Redis Query Engine by default\n- [Redis Cloud](https://cloud.redis.io/?utm_source=n8n&utm_medium=docs) - fully managed service\n- [Redis Software](https://redis.io/software/?utm_source=n8n&utm_medium=docs) - self-managed deployment\n\nA new index will be created if you don't have one.\n\nCreating your own indices in advance is only necessary if you want to use a custom index schema or reuse an existing index. Otherwise, you can skip this step and let the node create a new index for you based on the options you specify.\n\n## Node usage patterns\n\nYou can use the Redis Vector Store node in the following patterns:\n\n### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents\n\nYou can use the Redis Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Redis Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.\n\nYou can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (the template uses the Supabase Vector Store, but the pattern is the same).\n\n### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool\n\nYou can connect the Redis Vector Store node directly to the [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.\n\nHere, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Redis Vector Store node.\n\n### Use a retriever to fetch documents\n\nYou can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Redis Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Redis Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.\n\nAn [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Redis Vector Store.\n\n### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions\n\nAnother pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Redis Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Redis Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.\n\nThe [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2464-scale-deal-flow-with-a-pitch-deck-ai-vision-chatbot-and-qdrant-vector-store/) (the linked example uses Qdrant, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Redis Vector store.\n\nThis Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.\n\nIn this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt is embedded and used for similarity search. The node returns the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.\n\n#### Insert Documents\n\nUse insert documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.\n\n#### Retrieve Documents (as Vector Store for Chain/Tool)\n\nUse Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.\n\n#### Retrieve Documents (as Tool for AI Agent)\n\nUse Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.\n\nEnables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.\n\n### Get Many parameters\n\n- **Redis Index**: Enter the name of the Redis vector search index to use. Optionally choose an existing one from the list.\n- **Prompt**: Enter the search query.\n- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.\n\nThis Operation Mode includes one **Node option**, the [Metadata Filter](#metadata-filter).\n\n### Insert Documents parameters\n\n- **Redis Index**: Enter the name of the Redis vector search index to use. Optionally choose an existing one from the list.\n\n### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters\n\n- **Redis Index**: Enter the name of the Redis vector search index to use.\n\nThis Operation Mode includes one **Node option**, the [Metadata Filter](#metadata-filter). Optionally choose an existing one from the list.\n\n### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters\n\n- **Name**: The name of the vector store.\n- **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.\n- **Redis Index**: Enter the name of the Redis vector search index to use. Optionally choose an existing one from the list.\n- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.\n\nWhether to include document metadata.\n\nYou can use this with the [Get Many](#get-many-parameters) and [Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)](#retrieve-documents-as-tool-for-ai-agent-parameters) modes.\n\nMetadata filters are available for the [Get Many](#get-many-parameters), [Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)](#retrieve-documents-as-vector-store-for-chaintool-parameters), and [Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)](#retrieve-documents-as-tool-for-ai-agent-parameters) operation modes. This is an `OR` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, at least one of them must match. When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.\n\n### Redis Configuration Options\n\nAvailable for all operation modes:\n\n- **Metadata Key**: Enter the key for the metadata field in the Redis hash (default: `metadata`).\n- **Key Prefix**: Enter the key prefix for storing documents (default: `doc:`).\n- **Content Key**: Enter the key for the content field in the Redis hash (default: `content`).\n- **Embedding Key**: Enter the key for the embedding field in the Redis hash (default: `embedding`).\n\nAvailable for the [Insert Documents](#insert-documents-parameters) operation mode:\n\n- **Overwrite Documents**: Select whether to overwrite existing documents (turned on) or not (turned off). Also deletes the index.\n- **Time-to-Live**: Enter the time-to-live for documents in seconds. Does not expire the index.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Explore n8n Nodes in a Visual Reference Library**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/3891-explore-n8n-nodes-in-a-visual-reference-library/)\n\n**🐶 AI Agent for PetShop Appointments (Agente de IA para agendamentos de PetShop)**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2999-ai-agent-for-petshop-appointments-agente-de-ia-para-agendamentos-de-petshop/)\n\n**🤖 AI-Powered WhatsApp Assistant for Restaurants & Delivery Automation**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/3043-ai-powered-whatsapp-assistant-for-restaurants-and-delivery-automation/)\n\n[Browse Redis Vector Store integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/redis-vector-store/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\n- [Redis Vector Search documentation](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/ai/search-and-query/vectors/) for more information about Redis vector capabilities.\n- [RediSearch documentation](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/search-and-query/) for more information about RediSearch.\n- [LangChain's Redis Vector Store documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis) for more information about the service.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.\n\n## Self-hosted AI Starter Kit\n\nNew to working with AI and using self-hosted n8n?
