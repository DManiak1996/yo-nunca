This component is useful for node creators. If your node does insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. Often it's necessary to use a Set node before a node that sends data, to get the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node.\n\nRefer to [Node user interface elements | Resource mapper](../../integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/#resource-mapper) for guidance for node builders.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.230.2...n8n@0.230.3) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2023-06-05\n\nThis is a bug fix release.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.230.1...n8n@0.230.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2023-05-25\n\nThis is a bug fix release.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.230.0...n8n@0.230.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2023-05-25\n\nThis is a bug fix release.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.229.0...n8n@0.230.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2023-05-24\n\nThis release contains new features, new nodes, node enhancements, and bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nSave metadata for workflow executions.

executions list, and a new node to filter items in your workflows.\n\nUpgrade directly to 0.222.1.\n\nThis release introduces improvements to the execution lists. You can now save [Custom execution data](../../workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/), and use it to filter both the [All executions](../../workflows/executions/all-executions/) and [Single workflow executions](../../workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions/) lists.\n\n- Add test overrides.\n- Core: Improve LDAP/SAML toggle and tests.\n- Core: Limit user invites when SAML is enabled.\n- Core: Make OAuth2 error handling consistent with success handling.\n- Editor: Fix ResourceLocator dropdown style.\n\nThis release introduces the [Filter](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.filter/) node. The node allows you to filter items based on a condition. If the item meets the condition, the Filter node passes it on to the next node in the Filter node output. If the item doesn't meet the condition, the Filter node omits the item from its output.\n\n- Core: Assign `properties.success` earlier to set `executionStatus` correctly.\n- Core: Don't mark duplicates as circular references in `jsonStringify`.\n- Core: Don't use `util.types.isProxy` for tracking of augmented objects.\n- Core: Ensure that all non-lazy-loaded community nodes get post-processed correctly.\n- Core: Force-upgrade decode-uri-component to address CVE-2022-38900.\n- Core: Force-upgrade http-cache-semantics to address CVE-2022-25881.\n- Core: Handle `Date` and `RegExp` correctly in `jsonStringify`.\n- Core: Handle `Date` and `RegExp` objects in `augmentObject`.\n- Core: Improve Axios error handling in nodes.\n- Core: Improve community nodes loading.\n- Core: Initialize queue in the webhook server as well.\n- Core: Persist `CurrentAuthenticationMethod` setting change.\n- Core: Remove circular references from Code and push message.\n- Core: Require authentication on icons and nodes/credentials types static files.\n- Core: Return SAML service provider URls with configuration.\n- Core: Service account private key should display as a password field.\n- Core: Upgrade Luxon to address CVE-2023-22467.\n- Core: Upgrade simple-git to address CVE-2022-25912.\n- Core: Upgrade SQLite3 to address CVE-2022-43441.\n- Core: Upgrade Convict to address CVE-2023-0163.\n- Core: Waiting workflows not stopping.\n- Editor: Fix connection lost hover text not showing.\n- Editor: Fix issue preventing execution preview loading when in an iframe.\n- Editor: Use credentials when fetching node and credential types.\n- Google Sheets Node: Fix `insertOrUpdate` cell update with object.\n- HTTP Request Node: Add streaming to binary response.\n- HTTP Request Node: Fix AWS credentials to automatically deconstruct the URL.\n- HTTP Request Node: Fix AWS credentials to stop removing URL parameters for STS.\n- Split In Batches Node: Roll back changes in v1 and create v2.\n- Update PostHog no-capture.\n\n[Manish Dhanwal](https://github.com/ManishDhanwal07)\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.221.2...n8n@0.221.3) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2023-04-11\n\nThis is a bug fix release.\n\n- Code node: Update vm2 to address CVE-2023-29017.\n- Core: Update xml2js to address CVE-2023-0842.\n\n[Loganaden Velvindron](https://github.com/loganaden)\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.221.1...n8n@0.221.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2023-03-24\n\nThis is a bug fix release.

This allows developers to build and share nodes as npm packages. Users can install community-built nodes directly in n8n.\n\n[Data pinning](../../data/data-pinning/) allows you to freeze and edit data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions. This avoids repeated API calls when developing a workflow, reducing calls to external systems, and speeding up workflow development.\n\nThis release introduces a drag and drop interface for [data mapping](../../data/data-mapping/), as a quick way to map data without using expressions.\n\n#### Simplify authentication setup for node creators\n\nThis release introduces a simpler way of handling authorization when building a node. All credentials should now contain an `authenticate` property that dictates how the credential is used in a request. n8n has also simplified authentication types: instead of specifying an authentication type and using the correct interface, you can now set the type as `\"generic\"`, and use the `IAuthenticateGeneric` interface.\n\nYou can use this approach for any authentication method where data is sent in the header, body, or query string. This includes methods like bearer and basic auth. You can't use this approach for more complex authentication types that require multiple calls, or for methods that don't pass authentication data. This includes OAuth.\n\nFor an example of the new authentication syntax, refer to n8n's [Asana node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/credentials/AsanaApi.credentials.ts).\n\n#### Other new features\n\n- Added a `preAuthentication` method to credentials.\n- Added more credentials tests.\n- Introduce automatic fixing for paired item information in some scenarios.\n\n### Node enhancements\n\n- [ERPNext node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.erpnext/): add credential tests, and add support for unauthorized certs.\n- [Google Drive node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrive/): add support for move to trash.\n- [Mindee node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mindee/): support new version.\n- [Notion node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notion/): support ignoring the Notion URL property if empty.\n- [Shopify node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.shopify/): add OAuth support.\n\n- API: add missing node settings parameters.\n- API: validate static data value for resource workflow.\n- Baserow Node: fix an issue preventing table names from loading.\n- Editor: hide the **Execute previous node** button when in read-only mode.\n- Editor: hide tabs if there's only one branch.\n- Roundup of link fixes in nodes.\n\n[Florian Bachmann](https://github.com/baflo) [Olivier Aygalenq](https://github.com/oaygalenq)\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.186.0...n8n@0.186.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2022-07-14\n\nThis is a bug fix release.

However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the HTTP Request node.\n\nOne of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. To simplify this, n8n now provides a way to use existential credential types (credentials associated with n8n nodes) in the HTTP Request node.\n\nFor more information, refer to [Custom API operations](../../integrations/custom-operations/).\n\n#### Node details view\n\nAn improved node view, showing more detail about node inputs.\n\n### Node enhancements\n\n[Salesforce Node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.salesforce/): Add the **Country** field.\n\n- **Editor UI**: don't display the dividing line unless necessary.\n- **Editor UI**: don't display the 'Welcome' sticky in template workflows.\n- [Slack Node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/): Fix the kick operation for the channel resource.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.176.0...n8n@0.177.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2022-05-17\n\nThis release contains node enhancements, an improved welcome experience, and bug fixes.\n\n#### Improved welcome experience\n\nA new [introductory video](https://youtu.be/RpjQTGKm-ok), automatically displayed for new users.\n\n#### Automatically convert Luxon dates to strings\n\nn8n now automatically converts Luxon DateTime objects to strings.\n\n### Node enhancements\n\n- [Google Drive Node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrive/): Drive upload, delete, and share operations now support shared Drives.\n- [Microsoft OneDrive](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftonedrive/): Add the rename operation for files and folders.\n- [Trello](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.trello/): Add support for operations relating to board members.\n\n- **core:** Fix call to `/executions-current` with unsaved workflow.\n- **core:** Fix issue with fixedCollection having all default values.\n- [Edit Image Node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.editimage/): Fix font selection.\n- [Ghost Node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.ghost/): Fix post tags and add credential tests.\n- [Google Calendar Node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlecalendar/): Make it work with public calendars and clean up.\n- [KoBoToolbox Node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.kobotoolbox/): Fix query and sort + use question name in attachments.\n- [Mailjet Trigger Node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mailjet/): Fix issue that node couldn't get activated.\n- [Pipedrive Node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pipedrive/): Fix resolve properties when using multi option field.\n\n[Cristobal Schlaubitz Garcia](https://github.com/CxGarcia) [Yann Jouanique](https://github.com/Yann-J)\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.175.1...n8n@0.176.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2022-05-10\n\nThis release contains bug fixes and node enhancements.\n\n### Node enhancements\n\n- [Pipedrive node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pipedrive/): adds support for filters to the Organization: Get All operation.\n- [Pushover node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pushover/): adds an HTML formatting option, and a credential test.\n- [UProc node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.uproc/): adds new tools.\n\n- **core**: a fix for filtering the executions list by waiting status.\n- **core**: improved webhook error messages.\n- [Edit Image node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.editimage/): node now works correctly with the binary-data-mode 'filesystem'.\n\n[Albert Kiskorov](https://github.com/Albatrosicks) [Miquel Colomer](https://github.com/mcolomer)\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.175.0...n8n@0.175.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2022-05-03\n\nThis is a bug fix release.\n\nFixes a bug in the editor UI related to node versioning.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.174.0...n8n@0.175.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2022-05-02\n\nThis release adds support for node versioning, along with node enhancements and bug fixes.\n\n0.175.0 adds support for a lightweight method of node versioning. One node can contain multiple versions, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature, change the `version` parameter in your node to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version. You can then access the version parameter with `@version` in your `displayOptions` (to control which version n8n displays). You can also query the version in your `execute` function using `const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;`.\n\n### Node enhancements\n\n- [Google Sheets node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/): n8n now handles header names formatted as JSON paths.\n- [Microsoft Dynamics CRM node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftdynamicscrm/): add support for regions other than North America.\n- [Telegram node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/): add support for querying chat administrators.\n\n- **core**: fixed an issue that was causing n8n to apply authentication checks, even when user management was disabled.\n- **core**: n8n now skips credentials checks for disabled nodes.\n- **editor**: fix a bug affecting touchscreen monitors.\n- [HubSpot node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.hubspot/): fix for search operators.\n- [SendGrid node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendgrid/): fixed an issue with sending attachments.\n- [Wise node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wise/): respect the time parameter on `get: exchangeRate`.\n\n[Jack Rudenko](https://github.com/erudenko) [MC Naveen](https://github.com/mcnaveen) [vcrwr](https://github.com/vcrwr)\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.173.1...n8n@0.174.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2022-04-25\n\nThis release adds Sticky Notes, a new feature that allows you to annotate and comment on your workflows.
