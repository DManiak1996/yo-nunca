You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n- **Model**: Select the model to use to generate the embedding.\n\nLearn more about available models in the [Amazon Bedrock documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html).\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n[Browse Embeddings AWS Bedrock integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/embeddings-aws-bedrock/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [LangChains's AWS Bedrock embeddings documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/platforms/aws/#text-embedding-models) and the [AWS Bedrock documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) for more information about AWS Bedrock.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
