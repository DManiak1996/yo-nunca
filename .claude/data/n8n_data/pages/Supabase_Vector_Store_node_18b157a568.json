  "content": "Use the Supabase Vector Store to interact with your Supabase database as vector store. You can insert documents into a vector database, get many documents from a vector database, and retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a chain.\n\nUse the Supabase Vector Store to interact with your Supabase database as [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store). You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain), or connect it directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to use as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool). You can also update an item in a vector store by its ID.\n\nOn this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Supabase node, and links to more resources.\n\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/supabase/).\n\nParameter resolution in sub-nodes\n\nSub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.\n\nMost nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\nSupabase provides a [quickstart for setting up your vector store](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/langchain?database-method=sql). If you use settings other than the defaults in the quickstart, this may affect parameter settings in n8n. Make sure you understand what you're doing.\n\n## Node usage patterns\n\nYou can use the Supabase Vector Store node in the following patterns.\n\n### Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents\n\nYou can use the Supabase Vector Store as a regular node to insert, update, or get documents. This pattern places the Supabase Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.\n\nYou can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/).\n\n### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool\n\nYou can connect the Supabase Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.\n\nHere, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Supabase Vector Store node.\n\n### Use a retriever to fetch documents\n\nYou can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Supabase Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Supabase Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.\n\nAn [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the example uses Pinecone, but the pattern in the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Supabase Vector Store.\n\n### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions\n\nAnother pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Supabase Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Supabase Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.\n\nThe [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Supabase Vector store.\n\nThis Vector Store node has five modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**, and **Update Documents**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.\n\nIn this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.\n\n#### Insert Documents\n\nUse Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.\n\n#### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)\n\nUse Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.\n\n#### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)\n\nUse Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.\n\n#### Update Documents\n\nUse Update Documents mode to update documents in a vector database by ID. Fill in the **ID** with the ID of the embedding entry to update.\n\nEnables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.\n\n### Get Many parameters\n\n- **Table Name**: Enter the Supabase table to use.\n- **Prompt**: Enter the search query.\n- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.\n\n### Insert Documents parameters\n\n- **Table Name**: Enter the Supabase table to use.\n\n### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters\n\n- **Table Name**: Enter the Supabase table to use.\n\n### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters\n\n- **Name**: The name of the vector store.\n- **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.\n- **Table Name**: Enter the Supabase table to use.\n- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.\n\n- **Table Name**: Enter the Supabase table to use.\n- **ID**: The ID of an embedding entry.\n\nParameters for **Update Documents**\n\nThe name of the matching function you set up in Supabase. If you follow the [Supabase quickstart](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/langchain?database-method=sql), this will be `match_documents`.\n\nAvailable in **Get Many** mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document.\n\nThis is an `AND` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.\n\nWhen inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**AI Agent To Chat With Files In Supabase Storage**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/)\n\n**Supabase Insertion & Upsertion & Retrieval**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2395-supabase-insertion-and-upsertion-and-retrieval/)\n\n**Automate Sales Cold Calling Pipeline with Apify, GPT-4o, and WhatsApp**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/5449-automate-sales-cold-calling-pipeline-with-apify-gpt-4o-and-whatsapp/)\n\n[Browse Supabase Vector Store integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/supabase-vector-store/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [LangChain's Supabase documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/supabase/) for more information about the service.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
