Only set this if necessary, since it increases processing.\n\nChoose the format to return the message in from these options:\n\n- **RAW**: This format returns the full email message data with body content in the raw field as a base64url encoded string. It doesn't use the payload field.\n- **Resolved**: This format returns the full email with all data resolved and attachments saved as binary data.\n- **Simple**: This format returns the full email. Don't use it if you want to gather inline attachments.\n\nYou can further configure the node using these **Options**.\n\n### Custom Email Rules\n\nEnter custom email fetching rules to determine which emails the node fetches.\n\nRefer to [node-imap's search function criteria](https://github.com/mscdex/node-imap) for more information.\n\n### Force Reconnect Every Minutes\n\nSet an interval in minutes to force reconnection.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Effortless Email Management with AI-Powered Summarization & Review**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2862-effortless-email-management-with-ai-powered-summarization-and-review/)\n\n**AI Email Analyzer: Process PDFs, Images & Save to Google Drive + Telegram**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/3169-ai-email-analyzer-process-pdfs-images-and-save-to-google-drive-telegram/)\n\n**A Very Simple \"Human in the Loop\" Email Response System Using AI and IMAP**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2907-a-very-simple-human-in-the-loop-email-response-system-using-ai-and-imap/)\n\n[Browse Email Trigger (IMAP) integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/email-trigger-imap/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)",
