  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [MQTT](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mqtt/)\n- [MQTT Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mqtttrigger/)\n\nInstall an [MQTT broker](https://mqtt.org/).\n\nMQTT provides a list of Servers/Brokers at [MQTT Software](https://mqtt.org/software/).\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\nRefer to [MQTT's documentation](https://mqtt.org/) for more information about the MQTT protocol.\n\nRefer to your broker provider's documentation for more detailed configuration and details.\n\n## Using broker connection\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- Your MQTT broker's **Protocol**\n- The **Host**\n- The **Port**\n- A **Username** and **Password** to authenticate with\n- If you're using **SSL**, the relevant certificates and keys\n\n1. Select the broker's **Protocol**, which determines the URL n8n uses. Options include:\n   - **Mqtt**: Begin the URL with the standard `mqtt:` protocol.\n   - **Mqtts**: Begin the URL with the secure `mqtts:` protocol.\n   - **Ws**: Begin the URL with the WebSocket `ws:` protocol.\n1. Enter your broker **Host**.\n1. Enter the **Port** number n8n should use to connect to the broker host.\n1. Enter the **Username** to log into the broker as.\n1. Enter that user's **Password**.\n1. If you want to receive QoS 1 and 2 messages while offline, turn off the **Clean Session** toggle.\n1. Enter a **Client ID** you'd like the credential to use. If you leave this blank, n8n will generate one for you. You can use a fixed or expression-based Client ID.\n   - Client IDs can be useful to identify and track connection access. n8n recommends using something with `n8n` in it for easier auditing.\n1. If your MQTT broker uses SSL, turn the **SSL** toggle on. Once you turn it on:\n   1. Select whether to use **Passwordless** connection with certificates, which is like the SASL mechanism EXTERNAL. If turned on:\n      1. Select whether to **Reject Unauthorized Certificate**: If turned off, n8n will connect even if the certificate validation fails.\n      1. Add an SSL **Client Certificate**.\n      1. Add an SSL **Client Key** for the Client Certificate.\n   1. One or more SSL **CA Certificates**.\n\nRefer to your MQTT broker provider's documentation for more detailed configuration instructions.",
