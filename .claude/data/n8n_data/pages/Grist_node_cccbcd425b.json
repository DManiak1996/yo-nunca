There are two ways to get the Row ID:\n\n**Create a Row ID column in Grist**\n\nCreate a new column in your Grist table with the formula `$id`.\n\n**Use the Get All operation**\n\nThe **Get All** operation returns the Row ID of each record along with the fields.\n\nYou can get it with the expression `{{$node[\"GristNodeName\"].json[\"id\"]}}`.\n\n## Filter records when using the Get All operation\n\n- Select **Add Option** and select **Filter** from the dropdown list.\n- You can add filters for any number of columns. The result will only include records which match all the columns.\n- For each column, you can enter any number of values separated by commas.
