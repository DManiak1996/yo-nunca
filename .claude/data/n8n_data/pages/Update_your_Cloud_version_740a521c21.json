Check the [Release notes](../../release-notes/) to learn more about changes.\n\nOnly instance owners can upgrade n8n Cloud versions. Contact your instance owner if you don't have permission to update n8n Cloud.\n\n1. [Log in to the n8n Cloud dashboard](https://app.n8n.cloud/manage)\n1. On your dashboard, select **Manage**.\n1.

Select **Save Changes** to restart your n8n instance and perform the update.\n1. In the confirmation modal, select **Confirm**.\n\n## Best practices for updating\n\n- Update frequently: this avoids having to jump multiple versions at once, reducing the risk of a disruptive update. Try to update at least once a month.\n- Check the [Release notes](../../release-notes/) for breaking changes.\n- Use [Environments](../../source-control-environments/) to create a test version of your instance. Test the update there first.\n\nn8n automatically updates outdated Cloud instances.\n\nIf you don't update you instance for 120 days, n8n emails you to warn you to update. After a further 30 days, n8n automatically updates your instance.",
