  "content": "This page contains advice on best practices relating to user management in n8n.\n\n- n8n recommends that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see all workflows, but there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.\n- Users must be careful not to edit the same workflow simultaneously. It's possible to do it, but the users will overwrite each other's changes.\n- To move workflows between accounts, export the workflow as JSON, then import it to the new account. Note that this action loses the workflow history.\n- Webhook paths must be unique across the entire instance. This means each webhook path must be unique for all workflows and all users. By default, n8n generates a long random value for the webhook path, but users can edit this to their own custom path. If two users set the same path value:\n  - The path works for the first workflow that's run or activated.\n  - Other workflows will error if they try to run with the same path.\n\nIf you run n8n behind a reverse proxy, set the following environment variables so that n8n generates emails with the correct URL:\n\n- `N8N_HOST`\n- `N8N_PORT`\n- `N8N_PROTOCOL`\n- `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`\n\nMore information on these variables is available in [Environment variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).",
