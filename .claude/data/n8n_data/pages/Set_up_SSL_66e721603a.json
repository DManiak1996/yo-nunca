  "content": "There are two methods to support TLS/SSL in n8n.\n\n## Use a reverse proxy (recommended)\n\nUse a reverse proxy like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) or a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in front of the n8n instance. This should also take care of certificate renewals.\n\nRefer to [Security | Data encryption](https://n8n.io/legal/#security) for more information.\n\n## Pass certificates into n8n directly\n\nYou can also choose to pass certificates into n8n directly. To do so, set the `N8N_SSL_CERT` and `N8N_SSL_KEY` environment variables to point to your generated certificate and key file.\n\nYou'll need to make sure the certificate stays renewed and up to date.\n\nRefer to [Deployment environment variables](../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) for more information on these variables and [Configuration](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on setting environment variables.",
