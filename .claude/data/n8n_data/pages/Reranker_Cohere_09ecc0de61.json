  "content": "The Reranker Cohere node allows you to [rerank](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking) the resulting chunks from a [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store). You can connect this node to a vector store.\n\nThe reranker reorders the list of documents retrieved from a vector store for a given query in order of descending relevance.\n\nOn this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Reranker Cohere node, and links to more resources.\n\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/cohere/).\n\nParameter resolution in sub-nodes\n\nSub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.\n\nMost nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\nChoose the reranking model to use. You can find out more about the available models in [Cohere's model documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models#rerank).\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Automate Sales Cold Calling Pipeline with Apify, GPT-4o, and WhatsApp**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/5449-automate-sales-cold-calling-pipeline-with-apify-gpt-4o-and-whatsapp/)\n\n**Create a Multi-Modal Telegram Support Bot with GPT-4 and Supabase RAG**\n\nby Ezema Kingsley Chibuzo\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/5589-create-a-multi-modal-telegram-support-bot-with-gpt-4-and-supabase-rag/)\n\n**Build an All-Source Knowledge Assistant with Claude, RAG, Perplexity, and Drive**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/6542-build-an-all-source-knowledge-assistant-with-claude-rag-perplexity-and-drive/)\n\n[Browse Reranker Cohere integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/reranker-cohere/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
