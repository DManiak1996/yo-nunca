  "content": "Use the Supabase node to automate work in Supabase, and integrate Supabase with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Supabase features, including creating, deleting, and getting rows.\n\nOn this page, you'll find a list of operations the Supabase node supports and links to more resources.\n\nRefer to [Supabase credentials](../../credentials/supabase/) for guidance on setting up authentication.\n\nThis node can be used as an AI tool\n\nThis node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).\n\n- Row\n  - Create a new row\n  - Delete a row\n  - Get a row\n  - Get all rows\n  - Update a row\n\n## Using custom schemas\n\nBy default, the Supabase node only fetches the `public` schema. To fetch [custom schemas](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/using-custom-schemas), enable **Use Custom Schema**.\n\nIn the new **Schema** field, provide the custom schema the Supabase node should use.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**AI Agent To Chat With Files In Supabase Storage**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/)\n\n**Autonomous AI crawler**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2315-autonomous-ai-crawler/)\n\n**Supabase Insertion & Upsertion & Retrieval**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2395-supabase-insertion-and-upsertion-and-retrieval/)\n\n[Browse Supabase integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/supabase/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\n## What to do if your operation isn't supported\n\nIf this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.\n\nYou can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:\n\n1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.\n1. Select the service you want to connect to.\n1.
