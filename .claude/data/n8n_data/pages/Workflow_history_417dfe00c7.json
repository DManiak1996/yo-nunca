  "content": "- Full workflow history is available on Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Self-hosted.\n- Versions from the last five days are available for Cloud Pro users.\n- Versions from the last 24 hours are available for registered Community users.\n\nUse workflow history to view and restore previous versions of your workflows.\n\n## Understand workflow history\n\nn8n creates a new version when you:\n\n- Save your workflow.\n- Restore an old version. n8n saves the latest version before restoring.\n- Pull from a Git repository using [Source control](../../source-control-environments/). Note that n8n saves versions to the instance database, not to Git.\n\nWorkflow history and execution history\n\nDon't confuse workflow history with the [Workflow-level executions list](../executions/single-workflow-executions/).\n\nExecutions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to [Debug and re-run past executions](../executions/debug/) in your current workflow.\n\nWorkflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.\n\n## View workflow history\n\nTo view a workflow's history:\n\n1. Open the workflow.\n1. Select **Workflow history** . n8n opens a menu showing the saved workflow versions, and a canvas with a preview of the selected version.\n\n## Restore or copy previous versions\n\nYou can restore a previous workflow version, or make a copy of it:\n\n1. On the version you want to restore or copy, select **Options** .\n1. Choose what you want to do:\n   - **Restore this version**: replace your current workflow with the selected version.\n   - **Clone to new workflow**: create a new workflow based on the selected version.\n   - **Open version in new tab**: open a second tab displaying the selected version. Use this to compare versions.\n   - **Download**: download the version as JSON.",
