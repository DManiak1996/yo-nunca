  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [Twist](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.twist/)\n\n- Create a [Twist](https://twist.com/) account.\n- [Create a general integration](https://twist.com/app_console/create_app) and configure a valid OAuth Redirect URL. Refer to [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2) for more information.\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\nRefer to [Twist's API documentation](https://developer.twist.com/v3/#authorization) for more information about authenticating with the service.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- A **Client ID**: Generated once you create a general integration.\n- A **Client Secret**: Generated once you create a general integration.\n\nTo generate your Client ID and Client Secret, [create a general integration](https://twist.com/app_console/create_app).\n\nUse these settings for your integration's **OAuth Authentication**:\n\n- Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and enter it as the **OAuth 2 redirect URL** in Twist.\n\nOAuth Redirect URL for self-hosted n8n\n\nTwist doesn't accept a `localhost` Redirect URL. The Redirect URL should be a URL in your domain, for example: `https://mytemplatemaker.example.com/gr_callback`. If your n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** contains localhost, refer below to [Local environment redirect URL](#local-environment-redirect-url) for generating a URL that Twist will allow.\n\n- Select **Update OAuth settings** to save those changes.\n\n- Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Twist and enter them in the appropriate fields in n8n.\n\n### Local environment redirect URL\n\nTwist doesn't accept a localhost callback URL. These steps should allow you to configure the OAuth credentials for the local environment:\n\n1. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose the local server running on port `5678` to the internet. In your terminal, run the following command:\n\n1. Run the following command in a new terminal. Replace `<YOUR-NGROK-URL>` with the URL that you get from the previous step.\n\n1. Use the generated URL as your **OAuth 2 redirect URL** in Twist.",
