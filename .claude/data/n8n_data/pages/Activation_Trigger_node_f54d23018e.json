  "content": "The Activation Trigger node gets triggered when an event gets fired by n8n or a workflow.\n\nn8n has deprecated the Activation Trigger node and replaced it with two new nodes: the [n8n Trigger node](../n8n-nodes-base.n8ntrigger/) and the [Workflow Trigger node](../n8n-nodes-base.workflowtrigger/). For more details, check out the entry in the [breaking changes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#01170) page.\n\nIf you want to use the Activation Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.\n\nThe Activation Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Activation Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.\n\n- Events\n  - **Activation**: Run when the workflow gets activated\n  - **Start**: Run when n8n starts or restarts\n  - **Update**: Run when the workflow gets saved while it's active\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n[Browse Activation Trigger integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/activation-trigger/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)",
