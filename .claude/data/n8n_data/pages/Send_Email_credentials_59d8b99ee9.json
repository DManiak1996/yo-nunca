  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [Send Email](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendemail/)\n\n- Create an email account on a service that supports SMTP.\n- Some email providers require that you enable or set up outgoing SMTP or generate an app password. Refer to your provider's documentation to see if there are other required steps.\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\nSimple Message Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a standard protocol for sending and receiving email. Most email providers offer instructions on setting up their service with SMTP. Refer to your provider's SMTP instructions.\n\n## Using SMTP account\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- A **User** email address\n- A **Password**: This may be the user's password or an app password. Refer to the documentation for your email provider.\n- The **Host**: The SMTP host address for your email provider, often formatted as `smtp.<provider>.com`. Check with your provider.\n- A **Port** number: The port depends on the encryption method:\n- Port `465` for SSL/TLS (implicit encryption)\n- Port `587` for STARTTLS (explicit encryption)\n- Port `25` for no encryption (not recommended) Check with your email provider for their specific requirements.\n- **SSL/TLS**: This toggle controls the encryption method:\n- Turn **ON** for port `465` (uses implicit SSL/TLS encryption)\n- Turn **OFF** for port `587` (uses STARTTLS explicit encryption)\n- Turn **OFF** for port `25` (no encryption)\n- **Disable STARTTLS**: When SSL/TLS is disabled, the SMTP server can still try to [upgrade the TCP connection using STARTTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS). Turning this on prevents that behaviour.\n- **Client Host Name**: If needed by your provider, add a client host name. This name identifies the client to the server.\n\n### Provider instructions\n\nRefer to the quickstart guides for these common email providers.\n\nRefer to [Gmail](gmail/).\n\nRefer to [Outlook.com](outlook/).\n\nRefer to [Yahoo](yahoo/).\n\n### My provider isn't listed\n\nIf your email provider isn't listed here, search for `SMTP settings` to find their instructions. (These instructions may also be included with `IMAP settings` or `POP settings`.)",
