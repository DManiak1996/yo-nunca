You build workflows on the [workflow canvas](../../glossary/#canvas-n8n).\n\n1. Select the **button** in the upper-left corner of the side menu. Select workflow.\n1. If your n8n instance supports projects, you'll also need to choose whether to create the workflow inside your **personal space** or a specific **project** you have access to. If you're using the community version, you'll always create workflows inside your personal space.\n1. Get started by adding a trigger node: select **Add first step...**\n\n1. Select the **create** button in the upper-right corner from either the **Overview** page or a specific **project**. Select workflow.\n1. If you're doing this from the **Overview** page, you'll create the workflow inside your personal space. If you're doing this from inside a project, you'll create the workflow inside that specific project.\n1. Get started by adding a trigger node: select **Add first step...**\n\nIf it's your first time building a workflow, you may want to use the [quickstart guides](../../try-it-out/) to quickly try out n8n features.\n\n## Run workflows manually\n\nYou may need to run your workflow manually when building and testing, or if your workflow doesn't have a trigger node.\n\nTo run manually, select **Execute Workflow**.\n\n## Run workflows automatically\n\nAll new workflows are inactive by default.\n\nYou need to activate workflows that start with a trigger node or Webhook node so that they can run automatically. When a workflow is inactive, you must run it manually.\n\nTo activate or deactivate your workflow, open your workflow and toggle **Inactive** / **Active**.\n\nOnce a workflow is active, it runs whenever its trigger conditions are met.",
