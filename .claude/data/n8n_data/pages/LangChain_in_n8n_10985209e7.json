  "content": "n8n provides a collection of nodes that implement LangChain's functionality. The LangChain nodes are configurable, meaning you can choose your preferred agent, LLM, memory, and so on. Alongside the LangChain nodes, you can connect any n8n node as normal: this means you can integrate your LangChain logic with other data sources and services.\n\n- [Learning resources](../langchain-learning-resources/): n8n's documentation for LangChain assumes you're familiar with AI and LangChain concepts. This page provides links to learning resources.\n- [LangChain concepts and features in n8n](../langchain-n8n/): how n8n represents LangChain concepts and features.",
