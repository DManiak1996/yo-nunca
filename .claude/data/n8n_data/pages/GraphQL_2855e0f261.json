  "content": "[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. Use the GraphQL node to query a GraphQL endpoint.\n\nThis node can be used as an AI tool\n\nThis node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).\n\nSelect the type of authentication to use.\n\nIf you select anything other than **None**, the **Credential for** parameter appears for you to select an existing or create a new authentication credential for that authentication type.\n\n### HTTP Request Method\n\nSelect the underlying HTTP Request method the node should use. Choose from:\n\n- **GET**\n- **POST**: If you select this method, you'll also need to select the **Request Format** the node should use for the query payload. Choose from:\n  - **GraphQL (Raw)**\n  - **JSON**\n\nEnter the GraphQL Endpoint you'd like to hit.\n\n### Ignore SSL Issues\n\nWhen you turn on this control, n8n ignores SSL certificate validation failure.\n\nEnter the GraphQL query you want to execute.\n\nRefer to [Related Resources](#related-resources) for information on writing your query.\n\nSelect the format you'd like to receive query results in. Choose between:\n\n- **JSON**\n- **String**: If you select this format, enter a **Response Data Property Name** to define the property the string is written to.\n\nEnter any **Headers** you want to pass as part of the query as **Name** / **Value** pairs.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Get top 5 products on Product Hunt every hour**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1298-get-top-5-products-on-product-hunt-every-hour/)\n\n**API queries data from GraphQL**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/216-api-queries-data-from-graphql/)\n\n**Bulk Create Shopify Products with Inventory Management from Google Sheets**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/5664-bulk-create-shopify-products-with-inventory-management-from-google-sheets/)\n\n[Browse GraphQL integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/graphql/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nTo use the GraphQL node, you need to understand GraphQL query language. GraphQL have their own [Introduction to GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) tutorial.",
