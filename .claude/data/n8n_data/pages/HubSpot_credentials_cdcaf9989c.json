The option still appears in n8n, but you should use the authentication methods listed above instead. If you have existing integrations using this API key method, refer to HubSpot's [Migrate an API key integration to a private app](https://web.archive.org/web/20240106022147/https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/migrate-an-api-key-integration-to-a-private-app) guide and set up an app token.\n\nRefer to [HubSpot's API documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/overview) for more information about the service. The [HubSpot Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.hubspottrigger/) node uses the Webhooks API; refer to [HubSpot's Webhooks API documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api-reference/webhooks-webhooks-v3/guide) for more information about that service.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need a [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) account or [HubSpot developer](https://developers.hubspot.com/) account and:\n\nTo generate an app token, create a private app in HubSpot:\n\n1. In your HubSpot account, select the **settings icon** in the main navigation bar.\n1. In the left sidebar menu, go to **Integrations > Private Apps**.\n1. Select **Create private app**.\n1. On the **Basic Info** tab, enter your app's **Name**.\n1. Hover over the **placeholder logo** and select the upload icon to upload a square image that will serve as the logo for your app.\n1. Enter a **Description** for your app.\n1. Open the **Scopes** tab and add the appropriate scopes. Refer to [Required scopes for HubSpot node](#required-scopes-for-hubspot-node) for a complete list of scopes you should add.\n1. Select **Create app** to finish the process.\n1. In the modal, review the info about your app's access token, then select **Continue creating**.\n1. Once your app's created, open the **Access token card** and select **Show token** to reveal the token.\n1. Copy this token and enter it in your n8n credential.\n\nRefer to the [HubSpot Private Apps documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/apps/legacy-apps/private-apps/overview) for more information.\n\n## Using Developer API key\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need a [HubSpot developer](https://developers.hubspot.com/) account and:\n\n- A **Client ID**: Generated once you create a public app.\n- A **Client Secret**: Generated once you create a public app.\n- A **Developer API Key**: Generated from your Developer Apps dashboard.\n- An **App ID**: Generated once you create a public app.\n\nTo create the public app and set up the credential:\n\n1. Log into your [HubSpot app developer account](https://developers.hubspot.com/).\n1. Select **Apps** from the main navigation bar.\n1. Select **Get HubSpot API key**. You may need to select the option to **Show key**.\n1. Copy the key and enter it in n8n as the **Developer API Key**.\n1. Still on the HubSpot **Apps** page, select **Create app**.\n1. On the **App Info** tab, add an **App name**, **Description**, **Logo**, and any support contact info you want to provide. Anyone encountering the app would see these.\n1. Open the **Auth** tab.\n1. Copy the **App ID** and enter it in n8n.\n1. Copy the **Client ID** and enter it in n8n.\n1. Copy the **Client Secret** and enter it in n8n.\n1. In the **Scopes** section, select **Add new scope**.\n1. Add all the scopes listed in [Required scopes for HubSpot Trigger node](#required-scopes-for-hubspot-trigger-node) to your app.\n1. Select **Update**.\n1. Copy the n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** and enter it as the **Redirect URL** in your HubSpot app.\n1. Select **Create app** to finish creating the HubSpot app.\n\nRefer to the [HubSpot Public Apps documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/apps/legacy-apps/public-apps/overview) for more detailed instructions.\n\n### Required scopes for HubSpot Trigger node\n\nIf you're creating an app for use with the [HubSpot Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.hubspottrigger/) node, n8n recommends starting with these scopes:\n\n| **Element** | **Object**        | **Permission** | **Scope name**               |\n| ----------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| n/a         | n/a               | n/a            | `oauth`                      |\n| CRM         | Companies         | Read           | `crm.objects.companies.read` |\n| CRM         | Companies schemas | Read           | `crm.schemas.companies.read` |\n| CRM         | Contacts          | Read           | `crm.objects.contacts.read`  |\n| CRM         | Contacts schemas  | Read           | `crm.schemas.contacts.read`  |\n| CRM         | Deals             | Read           | `crm.objects.deals.read`     |\n| CRM         | Deals schemas     | Read           | `crm.schemas.deals.read`     |\n\nSome HubSpot accounts don't have access to all the scopes. HubSpot is migrating accounts gradually. If you can't find all the scopes in your current HubSpot developer account, try creating a fresh developer account.\n\nNote for n8n Cloud users\n\nCloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.\n\nIf you're [self-hosting](../../../../hosting/) n8n, you'll need to configure OAuth2 from scratch by creating a new public app:\n\n1. Log into your [HubSpot app developer account](https://developers.hubspot.com/).\n1. Select **Apps** from the main navigation bar.\n1. Select **Create app**.\n1. On the **App Info** tab, add an **App name**, **Description**, **Logo**, and any support contact info you want to provide. Anyone encountering the app would see these.\n1. Open the **Auth** tab.\n1.
