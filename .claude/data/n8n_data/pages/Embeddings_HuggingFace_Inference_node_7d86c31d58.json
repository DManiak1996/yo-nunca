You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n- **Model**: Select the model to use to generate the embedding.\n\nRefer to the [Hugging Face models documentation](https://huggingface.co/models?other=embeddings) for available models.\n\n- **Custom Inference Endpoint**: Enter the URL of your deployed model, hosted by HuggingFace. If you set this, n8n ignores the **Model Name**.\n\nRefer to [HuggingFace's guide to inference](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints) for more information.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n[Browse Embeddings HuggingFace Inference integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/embeddings-hugging-face-inference/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [Langchain's HuggingFace Inference embeddings documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/text_embedding/hugging_face_inference/) for more information about the service.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
