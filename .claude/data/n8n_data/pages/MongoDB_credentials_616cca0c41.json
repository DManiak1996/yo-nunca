  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [MongoDB](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mongodb/)\n- [MongoDB Atlas Vector Store](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstoremongodbatlas/)\n- [MongoDB Chat Memory](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymongochat/)\n\n- Create a user account with the appropriate permissions on a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) server.\n- As a Project Owner, add all the [n8n IP addresses](../../../../manage-cloud/cloud-ip/) to the IP Access List Entries in the project's **Network Access**. Refer to [Add IP Access List entries](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/ip-access-list/#add-ip-access-list-entries) for detailed instructions.\n\nIf you are setting up MongoDB from scratch, create a cluster and a database. Refer to the [MongoDB Atlas documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/) for more detailed instructions on these steps.\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\n- Database connection - Connection string\n- Database connection - Values\n\nRefer to the [MongoDBs Atlas documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/) for more information about the service.\n\n## Using database connection - Connection string\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) listed above. Then:\n\n1. Select **Connection String** as the **Configuration Type**.\n1. Enter your MongoDB **Connection String**. To get your connection string in MongoDB, go to **Database > Connect**.\n   1. Select **Drivers**.\n   1. Copy the code you see in **Add your connection string into your application code**. It will be something like: `mongodb+srv://yourName:yourPassword@clusterName.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`.\n   1. Replace the `<password>` and `<username>` in the connection string with the database user's credentials you'll be using.\n   1. Enter that connection string into n8n.\n   1. Refer to [Connection String](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/) for information on finding and formatting your connection string.\n1. Enter your **Database** name. This is the name of the database that the user whose details you added to the connection string is logging into.\n1. Select whether to **Use TLS**: Turn on to use TLS. You must have your MongoDB database configured to use TLS and have an x.509 certificate generated. Add information for these certificate fields in n8n:\n   - **CA Certificate**\n   - **Public Client Certificate**\n   - **Private Client Key**\n   - **Passphrase**\n\nRefer to [MongoDB's x.509 documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-x.509/#std-label-client-x509-certificates-requirements) for more information on working with x.509 certificates.\n\n## Using database connection - Values\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) listed above. Then:\n\n1. Select **Values** as the **Configuration Type**.\n1. Enter the database **Host** name or address.\n1. Enter the **Database** name.\n1. Enter the **User** you'd like to log in as.\n1. Enter the user's **Password**.\n1. Enter the **Port** to connect over. This is the port number your server uses to listen for incoming connections.\n1. Select whether to **Use TLS**: Turn on to use TLS. You must have your MongoDB database configured to use TLS and have an x.509 certificate generated. Add information for these certificate fields in n8n:\n   - **CA Certificate**\n   - **Public Client Certificate**\n   - **Private Client Key**\n   - **Passphrase**\n\nRefer to [MongoDB's x.509 documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-x.509/#std-label-client-x509-certificates-requirements) for more information on working with x.509 certificates.",
