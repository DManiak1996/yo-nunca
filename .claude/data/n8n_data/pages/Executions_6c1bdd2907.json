  "content": "An execution is a single run of a workflow.\n\nThere are two execution modes:\n\n- Manual: run workflows manually when testing. Select **Execute Workflow** to start a manual execution. You can do manual executions of active workflows, but n8n recommends keeping your workflow set to **Inactive** while developing and testing.\n- Production: a production workflow is one that runs automatically. To enable this, set the workflow to **Active**.\n\nn8n provides two execution lists:\n\n- [Workflow-level executions](single-workflow-executions/): this execution list shows the executions for a single workflow.\n- [All executions](all-executions/): this list shows all executions for all your workflows.\n\nn8n supports [adding custom data to executions](custom-executions-data/).",
