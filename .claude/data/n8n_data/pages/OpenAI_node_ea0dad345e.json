  "content": "Use the OpenAI node to automate work in OpenAI and integrate OpenAI with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of OpenAI features, including creating images and assistants, as well as chatting with models.\n\nOn this page, you'll find a list of operations the OpenAI node supports and links to more resources.\n\nPrevious node versions\n\nThe OpenAI node replaces the OpenAI assistant node from version 1.29.0 on. n8n version 1.117.0 introduces V2 of the OpenAI node that supports the OpenAI Responses API and removes support for the [to-be-deprecated Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/migration).\n\nRefer to [OpenAI credentials](../../credentials/openai/) for guidance on setting up authentication.\n\n- **Text**\n  - [**Generate a Chat Completion**](text-operations/#generate-a-chat-completion)\n  - [**Generate a Model Response**](text-operations/#generate-a-model-response)\n  - [**Classify Text for Violations**](text-operations/#classify-text-for-violations)\n- **Image**\n  - [**Analyze Image**](image-operations/#analyze-image)\n  - [**Generate an Image**](image-operations/#generate-an-image)\n  - [**Edit an Image**](image-operations/#edit-an-image)\n- **Audio**\n  - [**Generate Audio**](audio-operations/#generate-audio)\n  - [**Transcribe a Recording**](audio-operations/#transcribe-a-recording)\n  - [**Translate a Recording**](audio-operations/#translate-a-recording)\n- **File**\n  - [**Delete a File**](file-operations/#delete-a-file)\n  - [**List Files**](file-operations/#list-files)\n  - [**Upload a File**](file-operations/#upload-a-file)\n- **Video**\n  - [**Generate a Video**](video-operations/#generate-video)\n- **Conversation**\n  - [**Create a Conversation**](conversation-operations/#create-a-conversation)\n  - [**Get a Conversation**](conversation-operations/#get-a-conversation)\n  - [**Update a Conversation**](conversation-operations/#update-a-conversation)\n  - [**Remove a Conversation**](conversation-operations/#remove-a-conversation)\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1954-ai-agent-chat/)\n\n**Building Your First WhatsApp Chatbot**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/)\n\n**Scrape and summarize webpages with AI**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1951-scrape-and-summarize-webpages-with-ai/)\n\n[Browse OpenAI integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/openai/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [OpenAI's documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction) for more information about the service.\n\nRefer to [OpenAI's assistants documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/how-it-works/objects) for more information about how assistants work.\n\nFor help dealing with rate limits, refer to [Handling rate limits](../../rate-limits/).\n\n## What to do if your operation isn't supported\n\nIf this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.\n\nYou can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:\n\n1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.\n1. Select the service you want to connect to.\n1. Select your credential.\n\nRefer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.\n\n## Using tools with OpenAI assistants\n\nSome operations allow you to connect tools. [Tools](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/) act like addons that your AI can use to access extra context or resources.\n\nSelect the **Tools** connector to browse the available tools and add them.\n\nOnce you add a tool connection, the OpenAI node becomes a [root node](../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n), allowing it to form a [cluster node](../../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) with the tools [sub-nodes](../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n). See [Node types](../../node-types/#cluster-nodes) for more information on cluster nodes and root nodes.\n\n### Operations that support tool connectors\n\n- **Text**\n  - [**Generate a Chat Completion**](text-operations/#generate-a-chat-completion)\n  - [**Generate a Model Response**](text-operations/#generate-a-model-response)\n\nFor common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](common-issues/).",
