You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n- **Limit**: Enter the maximum number of results to return.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Ask questions about a PDF using AI**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/)\n\n**AI Crew to Automate Fundamental Stock Analysis - Q&A Workflow**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2183-ai-crew-to-automate-fundamental-stock-analysis-qanda-workflow/)\n\n**Advanced AI Demo (Presented at AI Developers #14 meetup)**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2358-advanced-ai-demo-presented-at-ai-developers-14-meetup/)\n\n[Browse Vector Store Retriever integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/vector-store-retriever/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [LangChain's vector store retriever documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/vectorstore_retriever/) for more information about the service.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
