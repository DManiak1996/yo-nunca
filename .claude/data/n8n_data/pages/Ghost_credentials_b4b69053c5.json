The Content API uses an API key; the Admin API uses an API key to generate a token for authentication.\n\nRefer to Ghost's [Admin API documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/admin-api/) for more information about the Admin API service. Refer to Ghost's [Content API documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/) for more information about the Content API service.\n\n## Using Admin API key\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- The **URL** of your Ghost admin domain. Your [admin domain](https://ghost.org/docs/admin-api/#base-url) can be different to your main domain and may include a subdirectory. All Ghost(Pro) blogs have a `*.ghost.io` domain as their admin domain and require https.\n- An **API Key**: To generate a new API key, create a new Custom Integration. Refer to the [Ghost Admin API Token Authentication Key documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/admin-api/#token-authentication) for more detailed instructions. Copy the **Admin API Key** and use this as the **API Key** in the Ghost Admin n8n credential.\n\n## Using Content API key\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- The **URL** of your Ghost admin domain.
