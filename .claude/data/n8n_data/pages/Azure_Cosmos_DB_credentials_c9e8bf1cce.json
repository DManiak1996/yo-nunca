Select **Overview** > **Keys** in the Azure portal for your Azure Cosmos DB. You can use either of the two account keys for this purpose.\n- A **Database**: The name of the Azure Cosmos DB database to connect to.\n\nRefer to [Get your primary key | Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-obtain-keys?tabs=azure-portal) for more detailed steps.\n\nHere are the known common errors and issues with Azure Cosmos DB credentials.\n\n### Need admin approval\n\nWhen attempting to add credentials for a Microsoft360 or Microsoft Entra account, users may see a message when following the procedure that this action requires admin approval.\n\nThis message will appear when the account attempting to grant permissions for the credential is managed by a Microsoft Entra. In order to issue the credential, the administrator account needs to grant permission to the user (or \"tenant\") for that application.\n\nThe procedure for this is covered in the [Microsoft Entra documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/grant-admin-consent).",
