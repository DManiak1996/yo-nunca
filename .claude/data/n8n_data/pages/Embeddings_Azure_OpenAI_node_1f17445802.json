You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n- **Model (Deployment) Name**: Select the model (deployment) to use for generating embeddings.\n- **Batch Size**: Enter the maximum number of documents to send in each request.\n- **Strip New Lines**: Select whether to remove new line characters from input text (turned on) or not (turned off). n8n enables this by default.\n- **Timeout**: Enter the maximum amount of time a request can take in seconds. Set to `-1` for no timeout.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Auto-Update Knowledge Base with Drive, LlamaIndex & Azure OpenAI Embeddings**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/9174-auto-update-knowledge-base-with-drive-llamaindex-and-azure-openai-embeddings/)\n\n**PDF RAG Agent with Telegram Chat & Auto-Ingestion from Google Drive**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/8860-pdf-rag-agent-with-telegram-chat-and-auto-ingestion-from-google-drive/)\n\n**Generate Contextual Recommendations from Slack using Pinecone**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/6018-generate-contextual-recommendations-from-slack-using-pinecone/)\n\n[Browse Embeddings Azure OpenAI integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/embeddings-azure-openai/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [LangChains's OpenAI embeddings documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/text_embedding/azure_openai/) for more information about the service.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
