  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [S3](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.s3/)\n\nCreate an account on an S3-compatible server. Use the S3 node for generic or non-AWS S3 like:\n\n- [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces)\n- [MinIO](https://min.io/)\n- [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/)\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\nRefer to your S3-compatible provider's documentation for more information on the services. For example, refer to [Wasabi's REST API documentation](https://docs.wasabi.com/docs/rest-api-introduction) or [DigitalOcean's Spaces API Reference Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/).\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- An **S3 Endpoint**: Enter the URL endpoint for the S3 storage backend.\n- A **Region**: Enter the region for your S3 storage. Some providers call this the \"region slug.\"\n- An **Access Key ID**: Enter the S3 access key your S3 provider uses to access the bucket or space. Some providers call this API keys.\n- A **Secret Access Key**: Enter the secret access key for the **Access Key ID**.\n- **Force Path Style**: When turned on, the connection uses path-style addressing for buckets.\n- **Ignore SSL Issues**: When turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.\n\nMore detailed instructions for DigitalOcean Spaces and Wasabi follow. If you're using a different provider, refer to their documentation for more information.\n\n### Using DigitalOcean Spaces\n\nTo configure the credential for use with DigitalOcean spaces:\n\n1. In DigitalOceans, go to the control panel and open **Settings**. Your endpoint should be listed there. Prepend `https://` to that endpoint and enter it as the **S3 Endpoint** in n8n.\n   - Your DigitalOceans endpoint depends on the data center region your bucket's in.\n1. For the **Region**, enter the region your bucket's located in, for example, `nyc3`.\n   - If you plan to use this credential to create new Spaces, enter `us-east-1` instead.\n1. From your DigitalOceans control panel, go to [**API**](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/spaces).\n1. Open the **Spaces Keys** tab.\n1. Select **Generate New Key**.\n1. Enter a **Name** for your key, like `n8n integration` and select the checkmark.\n1. Copy the **Key** displayed next to the name and enter this as the **Access Key ID** in n8n.\n1. Copy the **Secret** value and enter this as the **Secret Access Key** in n8n.\n   - Refer to [Sharing Access to Buckets with Access Keys](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/how-to/manage-access/#access-keys) for more information on generating the key and secret.\n1. Keep the **Force Path Style** toggle turned off unless you want to use subdomain/virtual calling format.\n1. Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:\n   - To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of **Ignore SSL Issues** turned off.\n   - To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.\n\nRefer to DigitalOcean's [Spaces API Reference Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/) for more information.\n\nTo configure the credential for use with Wasabi:\n\n1. For the **S3 Endpoint**, enter the service URL for your bucket's region. Start it with `https://`.\n   - Refer to [Service URLs for Wasabi's Storage Regions](https://docs.wasabi.com/v1/docs/service-urls-for-wasabis-storage-regions) to identify the correct URL.\n1. For the **Region**, enter the region slug portion of the service URL. For example, if you entered `https://s3.us-east-2.wasabisys.com` as the **S3 Endpoint**, `us-east-2` is the region.\n1. Log into you Wasabi Console as the root user.\n1. Open the **Menu** and select **Access Keys**.\n1. Select **CREATE NEW ACCESS KEY**.\n1. Select whether the key is for the **Root User** or a **Sub-User** and select **CREATE**.\n1. Copy the **Access Key** and enter it in n8n as the **Access Key ID**.\n1. Copy the **Secret Key** and enter it in n8n as the **Secret Access Key**.\n   - Refer to [Creating a New Access Key](https://docs.wasabi.com/v1/docs/creating-a-new-access-key) for more information on generating the key and secret.\n1. Wasabi recommends turning on the **Force Path Style** toggle \"because the path-style offers the greatest flexibility in bucket names, avoiding domain name issues.\" Refer to the Wasabi [REST API Introduction](https://docs.wasabi.com/docs/rest-api-introduction) for more information.\n1. Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:\n   - To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of **Ignore SSL Issues** turned off.\n   - To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.",
