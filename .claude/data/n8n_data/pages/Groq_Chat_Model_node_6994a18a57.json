You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n- **Model**: Select the model which will generate the completion. n8n dynamically loads available models from the Groq API. Learn more in the [Groq model documentation](https://console.groq.com/docs/models).\n\n- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.\n- **Sampling Temperature**: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Conversational Interviews with AI Agents and n8n Forms**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2566-conversational-interviews-with-ai-agents-and-n8n-forms/)\n\n**Telegram chat with PDF**\n\nby felipe biava cataneo\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2392-telegram-chat-with-pdf/)\n\n**Build an AI-Powered Tech Radar Advisor with SQL DB, RAG, and Routing Agents**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/3151-build-an-ai-powered-tech-radar-advisor-with-sql-db-rag-and-routing-agents/)\n\n[Browse Groq Chat Model integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/groq-chat-model/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [Groq's API documentation](https://console.groq.com/docs/quickstart) for more information about the service.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
