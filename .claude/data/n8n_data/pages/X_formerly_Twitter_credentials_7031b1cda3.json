  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [X (formerly Twitter)](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.twitter/)\n\n- Create an [X developer](https://developer.x.com/en) account.\n- Create a [Twitter app](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/apps) or use the default project and app created when you sign up for the developer portal. Refer to each supported authentication method below for more details on the app's configuration.\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\nn8n used to support an **OAuth** authentication method, which used X's [OAuth 1.0a](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a) authentication method. n8n deprecated this method with the release of V2 of the X node in n8n version [0.236.0](../../../../release-notes/0-x/#n8n02360).\n\nRefer to [X's API documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api) for more information about the service. Refer to [X's API authentication documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/overview) for more information about authenticating with the service.\n\nRefer to [Application-only Authentication](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only) for more information about app-only authentication.\n\nUse this method if you're using n8n version 0.236.0 or later.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- A **Client ID**\n- A **Client Secret**\n\nTo generate your Client ID and Client Secret:\n\n1. In the Twitter [developer portal](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard), open your project.\n1. On the project's **Overview** tab, find the **Apps** section and select **Add App**.\n1. Give your app a **Name** and select **Next**.\n1. Go to the **App Settings**.\n1. In the **User authentication settings**, select **Set Up**.\n1. Set the **App permissions**. Choose **Read and write and Direct message** if you want to use all functions of the n8n X node.\n1. In the **Type of app** section, select **Web App, Automated App or Bot**.\n1. In n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**.\n1. In your X app, find the **App Info** section and paste that URL in as the **Callback URI / Redirect URL**.\n1. Add a **Website URL**.\n1. Save your changes.\n1. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** displayed in X and add them to the corresponding fields in your n8n credential.\n\nRefer to X's [OAuth 2.0 Authentication documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0) for more information on working with this authentication method.\n\nThis credential uses the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token authentication method, so you'll be subject to app rate limits. Refer to [X rate limits](#x-rate-limits) below for more information.\n\nX has time-based rate limits per endpoint based on your developer access plan level. X calculates app rate limits and user rate limits independently. Refer to [Rate limits](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) for the access plan level rate limits and guidance on avoiding hitting them.\n\nUse the guidance below for calculating rate limits:\n\n- If you're using the deprecated OAuth method, user rate limits apply. You'll have one limit per time window for each set of users' access tokens.\n- If you're [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2), app rate limits apply. You'll have a limit per time window for requests made by your app.\n\nX calculates user rate limits and app rate limits independently.\n\nRefer to X's [Rate limits and authentication methods](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits#auth) for more information about these rate limit types.",
