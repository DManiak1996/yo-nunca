  "content": "The Vector Store Question Answer node is a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) that allows an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to summarize results and answer questions based on chunks from a [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store).\n\nOn this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Vector Store Question Answer node, and links to more resources.\n\nExamples and templates\n\nFor usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Vector Store Question Answer Tool integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/vector-store-tool/) page.\n\nParameter resolution in sub-nodes\n\nSub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.\n\nMost nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n### Description of Data\n\nEnter a description of the data in the vector store.\n\nThe maximum number of results to return.\n\n## How n8n populates the tool description\n\nn8n uses the node name (select the name to edit) and **Description of Data** parameter to populate the tool description for AI agents using the following format:\n\n> Useful for when you need to answer questions about [node name]. Whenever you need information about [Description of Data], you should ALWAYS use this. Input should be a fully formed question.\n\nSpaces in the node name are converted to underscores in the tool description.\n\nAvoid special characters in node names\n\nUsing special characters in the node name will cause errors when the agent runs:\n\nUse only alphanumeric characters, spaces, dashes, and underscores in node names.\n\nView [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/vector-store-tool/) on n8n's website.\n\nRefer to [LangChain's documentation on tools](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/tool-calling/) for more information about tools in LangChain.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
