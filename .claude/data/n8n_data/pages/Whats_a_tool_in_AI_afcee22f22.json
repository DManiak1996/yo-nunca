  "content": "In AI, 'tools' has a specific meaning. Tools act like addons that your AI can use to access extra context or resources.\n\nHere are a couple of other ways of expressing it:\n\n> Tools are interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world ([source](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/tool-calling/))\n\n> We can think of these tools as being almost like functions that your AI model can call ([source](https://www.udemy.com/course/chatgpt-and-langchain-the-complete-developers-masterclass/))\n\nn8n provides tool [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that you can connect to your [AI agent](../../../glossary/#ai-agent). As well as providing some popular tools, such as [Wikipedia](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolwikipedia/) and [SerpAPI](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolserpapi/), n8n provides three especially powerful tools:\n\n- [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/): use this to load any n8n workflow as a tool.\n- [Custom Code Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode/): write code that your agent can run.\n- [HTTP Request Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/): make calls to fetch a website or data from an API.\n\nThe next three examples highlight the Call n8n Workflow Tool:\n\n- [Chat with Google Sheets](../data-google-sheets/)\n- [Call an API to fetch data](../api-workflow-tool/)\n- [Set up a human fallback](../human-fallback/)\n\nYou can also learn how to [let AI dynamically specify parameters for tools with the `$fromAI()` function](../using-the-fromai-function/).",
