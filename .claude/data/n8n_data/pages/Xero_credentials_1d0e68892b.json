For cloud users, for example, this is: `https://your-username.app.n8n.cloud/`.\n- Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and add it as an **OAuth 2.0 redirect URI** in your app.\n- Select appropriate **scopes** for your app. Refer to [OAuth2 Scopes](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/oauth2/scopes/) for more information.\n  - To use all functionality in the [Xero](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xero/) node, add the `accounting.contacts` and `accounting.transactions` scopes.\n\nRefer to Xero's [OAuth Custom Connections](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/oauth2/custom-connections) documentation for more information.",
