In your n8n credential, select your AWS **Region**.\n1. Log in to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).\n1. In the navigation bar on the upper right, select your user name and then select **Security credentials**.\n1. In the **Access keys** section, select **Create access key**.\n1. On the **Access key best practices & alternatives page**, choose your use case. If it doesn't prompt you to create an access key, select **Other**.\n1. Select **Next**.\n1. Set a **description** tag value for the access key to make it easier to identify, for example `n8n integration`.\n1. Select **Create access key**.\n1. Reveal the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** and enter them in n8n.\n1. To use a **Temporary security credential**, turn that option on and add a **Session token**. Refer to the [AWS Temporary security credential documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) for more information on working with temporary security credentials.\n1. If you use [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) to host n8n, you can establish a connection between your VPC and some apps. Use **Custom Endpoints** to enter relevant custom endpoint(s) for this connection. This setup works with these apps:\n   - Rekognition\n   - Lambda\n   - SNS\n   - SES\n   - SQS\n   - S3\n\nYou can also generate access keys through the AWS CLI and AWS API. Refer to the [AWS Managing Access Keys documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) for instructions on generating access keys using these methods.",
