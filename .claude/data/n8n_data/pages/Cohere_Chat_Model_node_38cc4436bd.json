  "content": "Use the Cohere Chat Model node to access Cohere's large language models for conversational AI and text generation tasks.\n\nOn this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Cohere Chat Model node, and links to more resources.\n\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/cohere/).\n\nParameter resolution in sub-nodes\n\nSub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.\n\nMost nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n- **Model**: Select the model which will generate the completion. n8n dynamically loads available models from the Cohere API. Learn more in the [Cohere model documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/models#command).\n\n- **Sampling Temperature**: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.\n- **Max Retries**: Enter the maximum number of times to retry a request.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Automate Sales Cold Calling Pipeline with Apify, GPT-4o, and WhatsApp**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/5449-automate-sales-cold-calling-pipeline-with-apify-gpt-4o-and-whatsapp/)\n\n**Create a Multi-Modal Telegram Support Bot with GPT-4 and Supabase RAG**\n\nby Ezema Kingsley Chibuzo\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/5589-create-a-multi-modal-telegram-support-bot-with-gpt-4-and-supabase-rag/)\n\n**Build a Document QA System with RAG using Milvus, Cohere, and OpenAI for Google Drive**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/3848-build-a-document-qa-system-with-rag-using-milvus-cohere-and-openai-for-google-drive/)\n\n[Browse Cohere Chat Model integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/cohere-chat-model/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [Cohere's API documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/reference/about) for more information about the service.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
