  "content": "This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.\n\nAWS offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including EC2 (virtual machines), and EKS (containers running with Kubernetes).\n\nThis guide uses [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.\n\nThe steps in this guide use a mix of the AWS UI and [the eksctl CLI tool for EKS](https://eksctl.io).\n\nWhile not mentioned in the documentation for eksctl, you also need to [install the AWS CLI tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), and [configure authentication of the tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).\n\nSelf-hosting knowledge prerequisites\n\nSelf-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:\n\n- Setting up and configuring servers and containers\n- Managing application resources and scaling\n- Securing servers and applications\n- Configuring n8n\n\nn8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).\n\nLatest and Next versions\n\nn8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).\n\nCurrent `latest`: 1.118.1\\\nCurrent `next`: 1.119.0\n\nUse the eksctl tool to create a cluster specifying a name and a region with the following command:\n\nThis can take a while to create the cluster.\n\nOnce the cluster is created, eksctl automatically sets the kubectl context to the cluster.\n\n## Clone configuration repository\n\nKubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting). The following steps tell you what each file does, and what settings you need to change.\n\nClone the repository with the following command:\n\nAnd change directory:\n\n## Configure Postgres\n\nFor larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.\n\n### Configure volume for persistent storage\n\nTo maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default AWS storage class, [gp3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/general-purpose.html#gp3-ebs-volume-type), is suitable for this purpose. This is defined in the `postgres-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest.\n\n### Postgres environment variables\n\nPostgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.\n\nThe example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own for user details and the database to use.\n\nThe `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.\n\n### Create a volume for file storage\n\nWhile not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes helps maintain files uploaded while using n8n and if you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](../../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts, which saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.\n\nThe `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.\n\n[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) lets you specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` file:\n\nThis defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:\n\n- **Start**: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable\n- **Pro (10k executions)**: 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable\n- **Pro (50k executions)**: 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable\n\n### Optional: Environment variables\n\nYou can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.\n\nCreate an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.\n\nThe two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.\n\nThe manifests define the following:\n\n- Send the environment variables defined to each application pod\n- Define the container image to use\n- Set resource consumption limits\n- The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.\n- Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.\n\nThe two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively by default.\n\n## Send to Kubernetes cluster\n\nSend all the manifests to the cluster by running the following command in the `n8n-kubernetes-hosting` directory:\n\nYou may see an error message about not finding an \"n8n\" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:\n\nn8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to a static address of the instance.\n\nTo find the address of the n8n service running on the instance:\n\n1. Open the **Clusters** section of the **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service** page in the AWS console.\n1. Select the name of the cluster to open its configuration page.\n1. Select the **Resources** tab, then **Service and networking** > **Services**.\n1. Select the **n8n** service and copy the **Load balancer URLs** value. Use this value suffixed with the n8n service port (5678) for DNS.\n\nThis guide uses HTTP connections for the services it defines, for example in `n8n-deployment.yaml`. However, if you click the **Load balancer URLs** value, EKS takes you to an \"HTTPS\" URL which results in an error. To solve this, when you open the n8n subdomain, make sure to use HTTP.\n\nIf you need to delete the setup, you can remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:\n\n- Learn more about [configuring](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../../scaling/overview/) n8n.\n- Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](../../../../try-it-out/).",
