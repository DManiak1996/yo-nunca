  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [Nextcloud](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.nextcloud/)\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\n- Basic auth\n- OAuth2\n\nRefer to [Nextcloud's API documentation](https://nextcloud-server.netlify.app/) for more information about the service.\n\nRefer to [Nextcloud's user manual](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/user_manual/en/contents.html) for more information on installing and configuring Nextcloud.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need a [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) account and:\n\n- Your **WebDAV URL**\n- Your **User** name\n- Your **Password** or an app password\n\n1. To create your **WebDAV URL**: If Nextcloud is in the root of your domain: Enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add `/remote.php/webdav/`. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, your WebDAV URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/remote.php/webdav`.\n   - If you have Nextcloud installed in a subdirectory, enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add `/<subdirectory>/remote.php/webdav/`. Replace `<subdirectory>` with the subdirectory Nextcloud's installed in.\n   - Refer to Nextcloud's [Third-party WebDAV clients](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/user_manual/en/files/access_webdav.html#third-party-webdav-clients) documentation for more information on constructing your WebDAV URL.\n1. Enter your **User** name.\n1. For the **Password**, Nextcloud recommends using an app password rather than your user password. To create an app password:\n   1. In the Nextcloud Web interface, select your avatar in the top right and select **Personal settings**.\n   1. In the left menu, choose **Security**.\n   1. Scroll to the bottom to the **App Password** section and create a new app password.\n   1. Copy that app password and enter it in n8n as your **Password**.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need a [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) account and:\n\n- An **Authorization URL** and **Access Token URL**: These depend on the URL you use to access Nextcloud.\n- A **Client ID**: Generated once you add an OAuth2 client application in **Administrator Security Settings**.\n- A **Client Secret**: Generated once you add an OAuth2 client application in **Administrator Security Settings**.\n- A **WebDAV URL**: This depends on the URL you use to access Nextcloud.\n\n1. In Nextcloud, open your **Administrator Security Settings**.\n\n1. Find the **Add client** section under **OAuth 2.0 clients**.\n\n1. Enter a **Name** for your client, like `n8n integration`.\n\n1. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and enter it as the **Redirection URI**.\n\n1. Then select **Add** in Nextcloud.\n\n1. In n8n, update the **Authorization URL** to replace `https://nextcloud.example.com` with the URL you use to access Nextcloud. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, the Authorization URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/apps/oauth2/authorize`.\n\n1. In n8n, update the **Access Token URL** to replace `https://nextcloud.example.com` with the URL you use to access Nextcloud. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, the Access Token URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/apps/oauth2/api/v1/token`.\n\nPretty URL configuration\n\nThe **Authorization URL** and **Access Token URL** assume that you've configured Nextcloud to use [Pretty URLs](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#pretty-urls). If you haven't, you must add `/index.php/` between your Nextcloud URL and the `/apps/oauth2` portion, for example: `https://cloud.n8n.com/index.php/apps/oauth2/api/v1/token`.\n\n1. Copy the Nextcloud **Client Identifier** for your OAuth2 client and enter it as the **Client ID** in n8n.\n\n1. Copy the Nextcloud **Secret** and enter it as the **Client Secret** in n8n.\n\n1. In n8n, to create your **WebDAV URL**: If Nextcloud is in the root of your domain, enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add `/remote.php/webdav/`. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, your WebDAV URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/remote.php/webdav`.\n\n- If you have Nextcloud installed in a subdirectory, enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add `/<subdirectory>/remote.php/webdav/`. Replace `<subdirectory>` with the subdirectory Nextcloud's installed in.\n   - Refer to Nextcloud's [Third-party WebDAV clients](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/user_manual/en/files/access_webdav.html#third-party-webdav-clients) documentation for more information on constructing your WebDAV URL.\n\nRefer to the Nextcloud [OAuth2 Configuration documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/oauth2.html) for more detailed instructions.",
