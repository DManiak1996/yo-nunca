Refer to [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) for an example of SSH setup.\n\nUse this method if you have a user account that can `ssh` into the server using their own password.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need to:\n\n1. Enter the IP address of the server you're connecting to as the **Host**.\n1. Enter the **Port** to use for the connection. SSH uses port `22` by default.\n1. Enter the **Username** for a user account with `ssh` access on the server.\n1. Enter the **Password** for that user account.\n\nUse this method if you have a user account that uses an SSH key for the server or service.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need to:\n\n1.

Enter the **Username** of the account that generated the private key.\n1. Enter the entire contents of your SSH **Private Key**.\n1.
