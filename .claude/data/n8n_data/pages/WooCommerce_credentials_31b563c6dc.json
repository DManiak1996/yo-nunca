Go to **WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > Rest API > Add key**.\n1. Select **Read/Write** from the **Permissions** dropdown.\n1. Copy the generated **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** and enter them into your n8n credentials.\n1. Enter your WordPress site URL as the **WooCommerce URL**.\n1. By default, n8n passes your credential details in the Authorization header. If you need to pass them as query string parameters instead, turn on **Include Credentials in Query**.\n\nRefer to [Generate Keys](https://developer.woocommerce.com/docs/getting-started-with-the-woocommerce-rest-api/#3-generate-keys) for more information.\n\n## Resolve \"Consumer key is missing\" error\n\nWhen you try to connect your credentials, you may receive an error like this: `Consumer key is missing`.\n\nThis occurs when the server can't parse the Authorization header details when authenticating over SSL.\n\nTo resolve it, turn on the **Include Credentials in Query** toggle to pass the consumer key/secret as query string parameters instead and retry the credential.",
