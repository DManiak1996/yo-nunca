  "content": "Remember [our friend Nathan](../../../level-one/chapter-3/)?\n\n**Nathan 🙋:** Hello, it's me again. My manager was so impressed with my first workflow automation solution that she entrusted me with more responsibility.\\\n**You 👩‍🔧:** More work and responsibility. Congratulations, I guess. What do you need to do now?\\\n**Nathan 🙋:** I got access to all our sales data and I'm now responsible for creating two reports: one for regional sales and one for orders prices. They're based on data from different sources and come in different formats.\\\n**You 👩‍🔧:** Sounds like a lot of manual work, but the kind that can be automated. Let's do it!\n\nNow that we know what Nathan wants to automate, let's list the steps he needs to take to achieve this:\n\n1. Get and combine data from all necessary sources.\n1. Sort the data and format the dates.\n1. Write binary files.\n1. Send notifications using email and Discord.\n\nn8n provides [core nodes](../../../../integrations/builtin/node-types/#core-nodes) for all these steps. This use case is somewhat complex. We should build it from three separate workflows:\n\n1. A workflow that merges the company data with external information.\n1. A workflow that generates the reports.\n1. A workflow that monitors errors in the second workflow.\n\n## Workflow prerequisites\n\nTo build the workflows, you will need the following:\n\n- An [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) account and [credentials](../../../../integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/).\n- A [Google](https://www.google.com/account/about/) account and [credentials](../../../../integrations/builtin/credentials/google/) to access Gmail.\n- A [Discord](https://discord.com/) account and webhook URL (you receive this using email when you sign up for this course).\n\nNext, you will build these three workflows with step-by-step instructions.",
