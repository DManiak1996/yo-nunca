You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n- **Model**: Select the model to use to generate the embedding.\n\nn8n dynamically loads models from the Google PaLM API and you'll only see the models available to your account.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Ask questions about a PDF using AI**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/)\n\n**Chat with PDF docs using AI (quoting sources)**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2165-chat-with-pdf-docs-using-ai-quoting-sources/)\n\n**RAG Chatbot for Company Documents using Google Drive and Gemini**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2753-rag-chatbot-for-company-documents-using-google-drive-and-gemini/)\n\n[Browse Embeddings Google PaLM integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/embeddings-google-palm/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [Langchain's Google PaLM embeddings documentation](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/text_embedding/google_palm/) for more information about the service.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
