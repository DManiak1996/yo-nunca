  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [Strapi](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.strapi/)\n\nCreate a [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) admin account with:\n\n- Access to an existing Strapi project.\n- At least one collection type within that project.\n- Published data within that collection type.\n\nRefer to the Strapi developer [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/quick-start) for more information.\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\n- API user account: Requires a user account with appropriate content permissions.\n- API token: Requires an admin account.\n\nRefer to [Strapi's documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest) for more information about the service.\n\n## Using API user account\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- A user **Email**: Must be for a user account, not an admin account. Refer to the more detailed instructions below.\n- A user **Password**: Must be for a user account, not an admin account. Refer to the more detailed instructions below.\n- The **URL**: Use the public URL of your Strapi server, defined in `./config/server.js` as the `url` parameter. Strapi recommends using an absolute URL.\n  - For Strapi Cloud projects, use the URL of your Cloud project, for example: `https://my-strapi-project-name.strapiapp.com`\n- The **API Version**: Select the version of the API you want your calls to use. Options include:\n  - **Version 3**\n  - **Version 4**\n\nIn Strapi, the configuration involves two steps:\n\n1. [Configure a role](#configure-a-role).\n1. [Create a user account](#create-a-user-account).\n\nRefer to the more detailed instructions below for each step.\n\nFor API access, use the Users & Permissions Plugin in **Settings > Users & Permissions Plugin**.\n\nRefer to [Configuring Users & Permissions Plugin](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/settings/configuring-users-permissions-plugin-settings) for more information on the plugin. Refer to [Configuring end-user roles](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles) for more information on roles.\n\nFor the n8n credential, the user must have a role that grants them API permissions on the collection type. For the role, you can either:\n\n- Update the default **Authenticated** role to include the permissions and assign the user to that role. Refer to [Configuring role's permissions](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles#configuring-roles-permissions) for more information.\n- Create a new role to include the permissions and assign the user to that role. Refer to [Creating a new role](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles#creating-a-new-role) for more information.\n\nFor either option, once you open the role:\n\n1. Go to the **Permissions** section.\n1. Open the section for the relevant collection type.\n1. Select the permissions for the collection type that the role should have. Options include:\n   - `create` (POST)\n   - `find` and `findone` (GET)\n   - `update` (PUT)\n   - `delete` (DELETE)\n1. Repeat for all relevant collection types.\n1. Save the role.\n\nRefer to [Endpoints](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest#endpoints) for more information on the permission options.\n\n### Create a user account\n\nNow that you have an appropriate role, create an end-user account and assign the role to it:\n\n1. Go to **Content Manager > Collection Types > User**.\n1. Select **Add new entry**.\n1. Fill in the user details. The n8n credential requires these fields, though your Strapi project may have more custom required fields:\n   - **Username**: Required for all Strapi users.\n   - **Email**: Enter in Strapi and use as the **Email** in the n8n credential.\n   - **Password**: Enter in Strapi and use as the **Password** in the n8n credential.\n   - **Role**: Select the role you set up in the previous step.\n\nRefer to [Managing end-user accounts](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/managing-end-users) for more information.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- An **API Token**: Create an API token from **Settings > Global Settings > API Tokens**. Refer to Strapi's [Creating a new API token documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/settings/API-tokens#creating-a-new-api-token) for more details and information on regenerating API tokens.\n\nAPI tokens permission\n\nIf you don't see the **API tokens** option in **Global settings**, your account doesn't have the **API tokens > Read** permission.\n\n- The **URL**: Use the public URL of your Strapi server, defined in `./config/server.js` as the `url` parameter. Strapi recommends using an absolute URL.\n\n- For Strapi Cloud projects, use the URL of your Cloud project, for example: `https://my-strapi-project-name.strapiapp.com`\n\n- The **API Version**: Select the version of the API you want your calls to use. Options include:\n\n- **Version 3**\n  - **Version 4**",
