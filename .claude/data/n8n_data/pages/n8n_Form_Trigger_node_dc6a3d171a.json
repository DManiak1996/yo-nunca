  "title": "n8n Form Trigger node",
  "content": "Use the n8n Form trigger to start a workflow when a user submits a form, taking the input data from the form. The node generates the form web page for you to use.\n\nYou can add more pages to continue the form with the [n8n Form](../n8n-nodes-base.form/) node.\n\n## Build and test workflows\n\nWhile building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL**. Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging.\n\nThere are two ways to test:\n\n- Select **Execute Step**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node, but not the rest of the workflow.\n- Select **Execute Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.\n\n## Production workflows\n\nWhen your workflow is ready, switch to using the **Production URL**. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form.\n\nWhen working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.\n\n## Set default selections with query parameters\n\nYou can set the initial values for fields by using [query parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Web_forms) with the initial URL provided by the n8n Form Trigger. Every [page in the form](../n8n-nodes-base.form/) receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger URL.\n\nQuery parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode.\n\nWhen using query parameters, [percent-encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like [URL Encode/Decode](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/) to format your query parameters using percent-encoding.\n\nAs an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties:\n\n- Production URL: `https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form`\n- Fields:\n  - `name`: `Jane Doe`\n  - `email`: `jane.doe@example.com`\n\nWith query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above:\n\nHere, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (`@`) with the string `%40` and the space character () with the string `%20`. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on.\n\nThese are the main node configuration fields:\n\n- **Basic Auth**\n- **None**\n\n#### Using basic auth\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting.\n- The **Password** that goes with that username.\n\nThe Form Trigger node has two URLs: **Test URL** and **Production URL**. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel. Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.\n\n- **Test URL**: n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Execute Step** or **Execute Workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.\n- **Production URL**: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution. Select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.\n\nSet a custom slug for the form.\n\nEnter the title for your form. n8n displays the **Form Title** as the webpage title and main `h1` title on the form.\n\nEnter the description for your form. n8n displays the **Form Description** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\\n` or `<br>` to add a line break.\n\nCreate the question fields for your form. Select **Add Form Element** to add a new field.\n\nEvery field has the following settings:\n\n- **Field Label**: Enter the label that appears above the input field.\n- **Element Type**: Choose from **Checkboxes**, **Custom HTML**, **Date**, **Dropdown**, **Email**, **File**, **Hidden Field**, **Number**, **Password**, **Radio Buttons**, **Text**, or **Textarea**.\n  - Select **Checkboxes** to include checkbox elements in the form. By default, there is no limit on how many checboxes a form user can select. You can set the limit by specifying a value for the **Limit Selection** option as **Exact Number**, **Range**, or **Unlimited**.\n  - Select **Custom HTML** to insert arbitrary HTML.\n    - You can include elements like links, images, video, and more. You can't include `<script>`, `<style>`, or `<input>` elements.\n    - By default, Custom HTML fields aren't included in the node output. To include the Custom HTML content in the output, fill out the associated **Element Name** field.\n  - Select **Date** to include a date picker in the form. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](../../../../code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information on formatting dates.\n  - Select **Dropdown List** > **Add Field Option** to add multiple options. By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, turn on **Multiple Choice**.\n  - Select **Radio Buttons** to include radio button elements in the form.\n  - Select **Hidden Field** to include a form element without displaying it on the form. You can set a default value using the **Field Value** parameter or pass values for the field using [query parameters](#set-default-selections-with-query-parameters).\n- **Required Field**: Turn on to require users to complete this field on the form.\n\nChoose when n8n sends a response to the form submission. You can respond when:\n\n- **Form Is Submitted**: Send a response to the user as soon as they submit the form.\n- **Workflow Finishes**: Use this if you want the workflow to complete its execution before you send a response to the user. If the workflow errors, it sends a response to the user telling them there was a problem submitting the form.\n\nSelect **Add Option** to view more configuration options:\n\n- **Append n8n Attribution**: Turn off to hide the **Form automated with n8n** attribute at the bottom of the form.\n- **Button Label**: The label to use for your form's submit button. n8n displays the **Button Label** as the name of the submit button.\n- **Form Path**: The final segment of the form's URL, for both testing and production. Replaces the automatically generated UUID as the final component.\n- **Ignore Bots**: Turn on to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers.\n- **Use Workflow Timezone**: Turn on to use the timezone in the [Workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/) instead of UTC (default). This affects the value of the `submittedAt` timestamp in the node output.\n- **Custom Form Styling**: Override the default styling of the public form interface with CSS. The field pre-populates with the default styling so you can change only what you need to.\n\n## Customizing Form Trigger node behavior\n\n### Format response text with line breaks\n\nYou can use one of the following methods to add line breaks to form response text:\n\n• Use HTML formatting instead of plain text in the formSubmittedText field • Replace newline characters (`\\n`) with HTML break tags (`<br>`) before sending the response • Consider using a custom HTML response page if you need more formatting control\n\n### Restrict form access with authentication\n\nYou can use one of the following options to add authentication to your form:\n\n• Use the OTP (One-Time Password) field with TOTP node validation for token-based authentication • Add a Wait node with form authentication as a secondary form page • Store hashed passwords in a database and compare against form submissions for validation • Use external authentication providers like Google Forms if you need advanced authentication\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**RAG Starter Template using Simple Vector Stores, Form trigger and OpenAI**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/5010-rag-starter-template-using-simple-vector-stores-form-trigger-and-openai/)\n\n**Unify multiple triggers into a single workflow**\n\nby Guillaume Duvernay\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/7784-unify-multiple-triggers-into-a-single-workflow/)\n\n**Backup and Delete Workflows to Google Drive with n8n API and Form Trigger**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/6751-backup-and-delete-workflows-to-google-drive-with-n8n-api-and-form-trigger/)\n\n[Browse n8n Form Trigger integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/n8n-form-trigger/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)",
