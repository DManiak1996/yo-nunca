  "content": "Use n8n to scrape a website, load the data into Pinecone, then query it using a chat workflow. This workflow uses the [HTTP node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to get website data, extracts the relevant content using the [HTML node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/), then uses the [Pinecone Vector Store node](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorepinecone/) to send it to Pinecone.\n\n[View workflow file](/_workflows/advanced-ai/examples/populate_a_pinecone_vector_database_from_a_website.json)\n\n- [HTTP node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/): fetches website data.\n- [HTML node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/): simplifies the data by extracting the main content from the page.\n- [Pinecone Vector Store node](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorepinecone/) and [Embeddings OpenAI](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.embeddingsopenai/): transform the data into vectors and store it in Pinecone.\n- [Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) and [Question and Answer Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) to query the vector database.\n\nTo load the template into your n8n instance:\n\n1. Download the workflow JSON file.\n1. Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.\n1. Copy in the JSON, or select **Workflow menu** > **Import from file...**.\n\nThe example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:\n\n- Yellow: notes and information.\n- Green: instructions to run the workflow.\n- Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.\n- Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example.",
