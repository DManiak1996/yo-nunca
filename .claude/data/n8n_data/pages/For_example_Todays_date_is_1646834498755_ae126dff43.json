It also tells Luxon that you want the duration in days.\n- `toObject()` turns the result of diff() into a more usable object. At this point, the expression returns `[Object: {\"days\":-<number-of-days>}]`. For example, on 9th March, `[Object: {\"days\":-291}]`.\n- `.days` uses JMESPath syntax to retrieve just the number of days from the object. For more information on using JMESPath with n8n, refer to our [JMESpath](../jmespath/) documentation. This gives you the number of days to Christmas, as a negative number.\n- `.toString().substring(1)` turns the number into a string and removes the `-`.\n- `+ \" days to Christmas!\"`: another string, with a `+` to join it to the previous string.",

      "code": "n8n provides built-in convenience functions to support data transformation in expressions for dates. Refer to [Data transformation functions | Dates](../../builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/) for more information.\n\n### Convert JavaScript dates to Luxon\n\nTo convert a native JavaScript date to a Luxon date:\n\n- In expressions, use the [`.toDateTime()` method](../../builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/#date-toDateTime). For example, `{{ (new Date()).ToDateTime() }}`.\n- In the Code node, use `DateTime.fromJSDate()`. For example, `let luxondate = DateTime.fromJSDate(new Date())`.\n\n### Convert date string to Luxon\n\nYou can convert date strings and other date formats to a Luxon DateTime object. You can convert from standard formats and from arbitrary strings.\n\nA difference between Luxon DateTime and JavaScript Date\n\nWith vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with `new Date('2019-06-23')`. In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as `DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23')` or `DateTime.fromFormat(\"23-06-2019\", \"dd-MM-yyyy\")`.\n\n#### If you have a date in a supported standard technical format:\n\nMost dates use `fromISO()`. This creates a Luxon DateTime from an ISO 8601 string. For example:",

Refer to Luxon's guide to [Parsing technical formats](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=parsing-technical-formats) for details.\n\n#### If you have a date as a string that doesn't use a standard format:\n\nUse Luxon's [Ad-hoc parsing](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=ad-hoc-parsing). To do this, use the `fromFormat()` function, providing the string and a set of [tokens](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=table-of-tokens) that describe the format.\n\nFor example, you have n8n's founding date, 23rd June 2019, formatted as `23-06-2019`.

To make this more readable, you can use Luxon's formatting functions.\n\nFor example, you want the field containing the date to be formatted as DD/MM/YYYY, so that on the 23rd June 2019, it returns `23/06/2019`.\n\nThis expression gets the date seven days before today, and converts it to the DD/MM/YYYY format.",
