  "content": "In n8n you can reference data from any previous node. This doesn't have to be the node just before: it can be any previous node in the chain. When referencing nodes further back, you use the expression syntax `$(node_name).item`.\n\nDiagram of threads for different items. Due to the item linking, you can get the actor for each movie using `$('Get famous movie actors').item`.\n\nSince the previous node can have multiple items in it, n8n needs to know which one to use. When using `.item`, n8n figures this out for you behind the scenes. Refer to [Item linking concepts](../item-linking-concepts/) for detailed information on how this works.\n\n`.item` fails if information is missing. To figure out which item to use, n8n maintains a thread back through the workflow's nodes for each item. For a given item, this thread tells n8n which items in previous nodes generated it. To find the matching item in a given previous node, n8n follows this thread back until it reaches the node in question.\n\nWhen using `.item`, n8n displays an error when:\n\n- The thread is broken\n- The thread points to more than one item in the previous node (as it's unclear which one to use)\n\nTo solve these errors, you can either avoid using `.item`, or fix the root cause.\n\nYou can avoid `.item` by using `.first()`, `.last()` or `.all()[index]` instead. They require you to know the position of the item that you’re targeting within the target node's output items. Refer to [Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes](../../../../code/builtin/output-other-nodes/) for more detail on these methods.\n\nThe fix for the root cause depends on the exact error.\n\n### Fix for 'Info for expressions missing from previous node'\n\nIf you see this error message:\n\n> ERROR: Info for expression missing from previous node\n\nThere's a node in the chain that doesn't return pairing information. The solution here depends on the type of the previous node:\n\n- Code nodes: make sure you return which input items the node used to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking in the code node](../item-linking-code-node/) for more information.\n- Custom or community nodes: the node creator needs to update the node to return which input items it uses to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking for node creators](../item-linking-node-building/) for more information.\n\n### Fix for 'Multiple matching items for expression'\n\nThis is the error message:\n\n> ERROR: Multiple matching items for expression\n\nSometimes n8n uses multiple items to create a single item. Examples include the Summarize, Aggregate, and Merge nodes. These nodes can combine information from multiple items.\n\nWhen you use `.item` and there are multiple possible matches, n8n doesn't know which one to use. To solve this you can either:\n\n- Use `.first()`, `.last()` or `.all()[index]` instead. Refer to [Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes](../../../../code/builtin/output-other-nodes/) for more detail on these methods.\n- Reference a different node that contains the same information, but doesn't have multiple matching items.",
