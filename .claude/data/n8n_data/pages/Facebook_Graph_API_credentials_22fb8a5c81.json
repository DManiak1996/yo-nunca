  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [Facebook Graph API](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebookgraphapi/)\n\nFacebook Trigger credentials\n\nIf you want to create credentials for the [Facebook Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/) node, follow the instructions mentioned in the [Facebook App credentials](../facebookapp/) documentation.\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\nRefer to [Meta's Graph API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview) for more information about the service.\n\n## Using app access token\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need a [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) account and:\n\n- An app **Access Token**\n\nThere are two steps in setting up your credential:\n\n1. [Create a Meta app](#create-a-meta-app) with the products you need to access.\n1. [Generate an App Access Token](#generate-an-app-access-token) for that app.\n\nRefer to the detailed instructions below for each step.\n\n### Create a Meta app\n\nTo create a Meta app:\n\n1. Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and select **Create App**.\n1. If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don’t want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**. The **Use cases** page opens.\n1. Select the **Use case** that aligns with how you wish to use the Facebook Graph API. For example, for products in Meta's **Business** suite (like Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Marketing API, App Events, Audience Network, Commerce API, Fundraisers, Jobs, Threat Exchange, and Webhooks), select **Other**, then select **Next**.\n1. Select **Business** and **Next**.\n1. Complete the essential information:\n   - Add an **App name**.\n   - Add an **App contact email**.\n   - Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it.\n1. Select **Create app**.\n1. The **Add products to your app** page opens.\n1. Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.\n1. Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app \"Live.\")\n1. Select **Save changes**.\n1. At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.\n1. In the left menu, select **Add Product**.\n1. The **Add products to your app** page appears. Select the products that make sense for your app and configure them.\n\nRefer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.\n\nFor more information on the app modes and switching to **Live** mode, refer to [App Modes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes) and [Publish | App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release#app-types).\n\n### Generate an App Access Token\n\nNext, create an app access token to use with your n8n credential and the products you selected:\n\n1. In a separate tab or window, open the [Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/).\n\n1. Select the **Meta App** you just created in the **Access Token** section.\n\n1. In **User or Page**, select **Get App Token**.\n\n1. Select **Generate Access Token**.\n\n1. The page prompts you to log in and grant access. Follow the on-screen prompts.\n\nYou may receive a warning that the app isn't available. Once you take an app live, there may be a few minutes' delay before you can generate an access token.\n\n1. Copy the token and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**.\n\nRefer to the Meta instructions for [Your First Request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/get-started#get-started) for more information on generating the token.",
