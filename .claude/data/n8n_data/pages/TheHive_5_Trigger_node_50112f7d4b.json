Copy the testing and production webhook URLs from TheHive Trigger node.\n\n1. Add the following lines to the `application.conf` file. This is TheHive configuration file:\n\n1. Replace `TESTING_WEBHOOK_URL` and `PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL` with the URLs you copied in the previous step.\n\n1. Replace `TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME` and `PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME` with your preferred endpoint names.\n\n1. Replace `ORGANIZATION_NAME` with your organization name.\n\n1.
