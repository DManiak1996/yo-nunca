Each item links back to previous items.\n\nYou need to understand this behavior if you're:\n\n- Building a programmatic-style node that implements complex behaviors with its input and output data.\n- Using the Code node or expressions editor to access data from earlier items in the workflow.\n- Using the Code node for complex behaviors with input and output data.\n\nThis section provides:\n\n- A conceptual overview of [Item linking concepts](item-linking-concepts/).\n- Information on [Item linking for node creators](item-linking-node-building/).\n- Support for end users who need to [Work with the data path](item-linking-code-node/) to retrieve item data from previous nodes, and link items when using the Code node.\n- Guidance on troubleshooting [Errors](item-linking-errors/).",
