  "title": "MySQL credentials",
  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [MySQL](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mysql/)\n- [Agent](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/)\n\nThe Agent node doesn't support SSH tunnels.\n\nCreate a user account on a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) server database.\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\n- Database connection\n\nRefer to [MySQL's documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/) for more information about the service.\n\n## Using database connection\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- The server **Host**: The database's host name or IP address.\n- The **Database** name.\n- A **User** name.\n- A **Password** for that user.\n- The **Port** number used by the MySQL server.\n- **Connect Timeout**: The number of milliseconds during the initial database connection before a timeout occurs.\n- **SSL**: If your database is using SSL, turn this on and add details for the SSL certificate.\n- **SSH Tunnel**: Choose whether to connect over an SSH tunnel. An SSH tunnel lets un-encrypted traffic pass over an encrypted connection and enables authorized remote access to servers protected from outside connections by a firewall.\n\nTo set up your database connection credential:\n\n1. Enter your database's hostname as the **Host** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the hostname:\n\n1. Enter your database's name as the **Database** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the database name:\n\n1. Enter the username of a **User** in the database. This user should have appropriate permissions for whatever actions you want n8n to perform.\n\n1. Enter the **Password** for that user.\n\n1. Enter the **Port** number used by the MySQL server (default is `3306`). Run this query to confirm the port number:\n\n1. Enter the **Connect Timeout** you'd like the node to use. The Connect Timeout is the number of milliseconds during the initial database connection the node should wait before timing out. n8n defaults to `10000` which is the default used by MySQL of 10 seconds. If you want to match your database's `connect_timeout`, run this query to get it, then multiply by 1000 before entering it in n8n:\n\n1. If your database uses SSL and you'd like to use **SSL** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. If you turn it on, enter the information from your MySQL SSL certificate in these fields:\n\n1. Enter the `ca.pem` file contents in the **CA Certificate** field.\n   1. Enter the `client-key.pem` file contents in the **Client Private Key** field.\n   1. Enter the `client-cert.pem` file contents in the **Client Certificate** field.\n\n1. If you want to use **SSH Tunnel** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. Otherwise, skip it. If you turn it on:\n\n1. Select the **SSH Authenticate with** to set the SSH Tunnel type to build:\n      - Select **Password** if you want to connect to SSH using a password.\n      - Select **Private Key** if you want to connect to SSH using an identity file (private key) and a passphrase.\n   1. Enter the **SSH Host**. n8n uses this host to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.\n   1. Enter the **SSH Port**. n8n uses this port to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.\n   1. Enter the **SSH User** to connect with. n8n uses this user to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.\n   1. If you selected **Password** for **SSH Authenticate with**, add the **SSH Password**.\n   1. If you selected **Private Key** for **SSH Authenticate with**:\n      1. Add the contents of the **Private Key** or identity file used for SSH. This is the same as using the `ssh-identity-file` option with the `shell-connect()` command in MySQL.\n      1. If the **Private Key** was created with a passphrase, enter that **Passphrase**. This is the same as using the `ssh-identity-pass` option with the `shell-connect()` command in MySQL. If the **Private Key** has no passphrase, leave this field blank.\n\nRefer to [MySQL | Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-ssl-rsa-files.html) for more information on working with SSL certificates in MySQL.
