  "content": "Here are some common errors and issues with the [Telegram node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.\n\n## Add a bot to a Telegram channel\n\nFor a bot to send a message to a channel, you must add the bot to the channel. If you haven't added the bot to the channel, you'll see an error with a description like: `Error: Forbidden: bot is not a participant of the channel`.\n\nTo add a bot to a channel:\n\n1. In the Telegram app, access the target channel and select the channel name.\n1. Label the channel name as **public channel**.\n1. Select **Administrators** > **Add Admin**.\n1. Search for the bot's username and select it.\n1. Select the checkmark on the top-right corner to add the bot to the channel.\n\nYou can only use `@channelusername` on public channels. To interact with a Telegram group, you need that group's Chat ID.\n\nThere are three ways to get that ID:\n\n1. From the Telegram Trigger: Use the [Telegram Trigger](../../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/) node in your workflow to get a Chat ID. This node can trigger on different events and returns a Chat ID on successful execution.\n1. From your web browser: Open Telegram in a web browser and open the group chat. The group's Chat ID is the series of digits behind the letter \"g.\" Prefix your group Chat ID with a `-` when you enter it in n8n.\n1. Invite Telegram's [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) to the group: Once you add it, the bot outputs a JSON file that includes a `chat` object. The `id` for that object is the group Chat ID. Then remove the RawDataBot from your group.\n\n## Send more than 30 messages per second\n\nThe Telegram API has a [limitation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#broadcasting-to-users) of sending only 30 messages per second. Follow these steps to send more than 30 messages:\n\n1. **Loop Over Items node**: Use the [Loop Over Items](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to get at most 30 chat IDs from your database.\n1. **Telegram node**: Connect the Telegram node with the Loop Over Items node. Use the **Expression Editor** to select the Chat IDs from the Loop Over Items node.\n1. **Code node**: Connect the [Code](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node with the Telegram node. Use the Code node to wait for a few seconds before fetching the next batch of chat IDs. Connect this node with the Loop Over Items node.\n\nYou can also use this [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/772).\n\n## Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages\n\nIf you're using the node to [send Telegram messages](../message-operations/#send-message), the message automatically gets an n8n attribution appended to the end:\n\n> This message was sent automatically with n8n\n\nTo remove this attribution:\n\n1. In the node's **Additional Fields** section, select **Add Field**.\n1. Select **Append n8n attribution**.\n1. Turn the toggle off.\n\nRefer to [Send Message additional fields](../message-operations/#send-message-additional-fields) for more information.",
