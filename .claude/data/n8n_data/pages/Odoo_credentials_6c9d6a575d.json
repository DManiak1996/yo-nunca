  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [Odoo](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.odoo/)\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\n- API key (Recommended)\n- Password\n\nRefer to [Odoo's External API documentation](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/developer/reference/external_api.html) for more information about the service.\n\nRefer to the Odoo [Getting Started tutorial](https://www.odoo.com/slides/getting-started-15) if you're new to Odoo.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need a user account on an [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) database and:\n\n- Your **Site URL**\n- Your **Username**\n- An **API key**\n- Your **Database name**\n\nTo set up the credential with an API key:\n\n1.
