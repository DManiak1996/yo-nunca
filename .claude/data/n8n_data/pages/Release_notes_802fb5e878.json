  "content": "New features and bug fixes for n8n.\n\nYou can also view the [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) in the GitHub repository.\n\nLatest and Next versions\n\nn8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).\n\nCurrent `latest`: 1.118.1\\\nCurrent `next`: 1.119.0\n\nThe steps to update your n8n depend on which n8n platform you use. Refer to the documentation for your n8n:\n\n- [Cloud](../manage-cloud/update-cloud-version/)\n- Self-hosted options:\n  - [npm](../hosting/installation/npm/)\n  - [Docker](../hosting/installation/docker/)\n\n## Semantic versioning in n8n\n\nn8n uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). All version numbers are in the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Version numbers increment as follows:\n\n- MAJOR version when making incompatible changes which can require user action.\n- MINOR version when adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner.\n- PATCH version when making backward-compatible bug fixes.\n\nYou can find the release notes for older versions of n8n [here](0-x/)\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.118.1...n8n@1.118.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-11-05\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.118.0...n8n@1.119.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-11-03\n\nThis is the `next` version. n8n recommends using the `latest` version. The `next` version may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).\n\nThis release includes multiple bug fixes for AI Agent, task runners, editor, and integrations, as well as new features like improved workflow settings, AWS Assume Role credentials, and enhanced security and audit capabilities.\n\nThe Guardrails node provides a set of rules and policies that control an AI agent's behavior by filtering its inputs and outputs. This helps safeguard from malicious input and from generating unsafe or undesirable responses. There are two operations:\n\n- Check Text for Violations: Validate text against a set of policies (e.g. NSFW, prompt injection).\n- Sanitize Text: Detects and replaces specific data such as PII, URLs, or secrets with placeholders.\n\nThe default presets and prompts are adapted from the open-source [guardrails package](https://github.com/openai/openai-guardrails-js) made available by OpenAI.\n\nFor more info, see [Guardrails documentation](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.guardrails/)\n\n[cesars-gh](https://github.com/cesars-gh)\\\n[ongdisheng](https://github.com/ongdisheng)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.118.0...n8n@1.118.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-10-28\n\nThis is the `latest` version. n8n recommends using the `latest` version.

Describe what you want to build, and n8n will generate a draft workflow by adding, configuring, and connecting nodes for you. From there, you can refine and expand the workflow directly in the editor.\n\n- Previously available to Starter and Pro users, AI Workflow Builder is now accessible to Enterprise Cloud users as well, with 1,000 monthly credits.\n- Supported on n8n version 1.115+. **If you don’t see the feature yet, open /settings/usage to trigger a license refresh.**\n- We’ve fixed a bug and now cloud users on v1.117.1 onwards will have access to a more reliable builder.\n- We’re currently working on bringing AI Workflow Builder to self-hosted users as well, including Community, Business, and Enterprise.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.116.0...n8n@1.117.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-10-21\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\n[jackfrancismurphy](https://github.com/jackfrancismurphy)\\\n[JiriDeJonghe](https://github.com/JiriDeJonghe)\\\n[ramkrishna2910](https://github.com/ramkrishna2910)\\\nOracle and/or its affiliates ([sudarshan12s](https://github.com/sudarshan12s))\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.116.1...n8n@1.116.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-10-21\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.115.3...n8n@1.115.4) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-10-21\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.116.0...n8n@1.116.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-10-14\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.115.0...n8n@1.116.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-10-13\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\n### Data migration tool\n\nYou can now easily migrate n8n data between different database types. This new tooling currently supports SQLite and Postgres, making the transition to a scaling database choice simpler, allowing you to take your data with you.\n\nThe tooling comes in the form of two new CLI commands, `export:entities` and `import:entities`\n\n**`Export`** The new export command lets you export data from your existing n8n database (SQLite / Postgres), producing a set of encrypted files within a compressed directory for you to move around and use with the import commands.\n\nFor details, see [Export entities](../hosting/cli-commands/#export-entities)\n\n**`Import`** The new import command allows you to read from a compressed and encrypted set of files generated from the new export command, and import them in to your new database of choice (SQLite / Postgres) to be used with your n8n instance.\n\nFor details, see [Import entities](../hosting/cli-commands/#import-entities)\n\n[JHTosas](https://github.com/JHTosas)\\\n[clesecq](https://github.com/clesecq)\\\n[Gulianrdgd](https://github.com/Gulianrdgd)\\\n[tishun](https://github.com/tishun)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.115.0...n8n@1.116.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-10-13\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\n[JHTosas](https://github.com/JHTosas)\\\n[clesecq](https://github.com/clesecq)\\\n[Gulianrdgd](https://github.com/Gulianrdgd)\\\n[tishun](https://github.com/tishun)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.115.2...n8n@1.115.3) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-10-14\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.115.1...n8n@1.115.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-10-10\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.114.3...n8n@1.114.4) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-10-07\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.114.0...n8n@1.115.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-10-06\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\n### AI Workflow Builder (Beta)\n\n**AI Workflow Builder** turns your natural language prompts into working automations. Describe what you want to build, and n8n will generate a draft workflow by adding and configuring nodes and wiring up the logic for you. From there, you can refine, expand, or adjust the workflow directly in the editor.\n\nThis feature helps you move from idea to implementation faster and without losing technical control. It’s especially helpful when starting from a blank canvas, validating an approach, or exploring new nodes and capabilities. Multi-turn interaction lets you iterate in conversation, turning your ideas into structured, production-ready workflows step by step.\n\nLearn more about how we we’re building this feature in our [forum post](https://community.n8n.io/t/ai-powered-workflow-building-coming-soon/196499).\n\n[](/_video/release-notes/AI_Workflow_Builder.webm)\n\n- This feature is initially going to be available for Cloud users on the 14-day Trial, Starter and Pro plans.\n- Availability for Enterprise users on Cloud will follow in a future update.\n- We are actively exploring the best way to bring this feature to self-hosted users.\n\n- To ensure the smoothest experience for all users, this feature will be rolled out to users on version 1.115.0 over the course of a week so you may not have access to the feature immediately when you upgrade to 1.115.0.\n\n**Credit limits by plan:** This feature will have monthly credit limits [by plan](https://n8n.io/pricing/).\n\n- Each prompt/interaction with the AI Workflow Builder consumes one credit.\n- Trial users have access to 20 credits, Starter plans have 50 per month and Pro plans will have 150 credits per month.\n- At this time, there will not be a way to access additional credits within your plan, however we are we are exploring this.\n\nLearn more about AI Workflow Builder in [documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/ai-workflow-builder/).\n\n### Source Control: Added HTTPS support\n\nYou can now connect to Git repositories via HTTPS in addition to SSH, making Source Control usable in environments where SSH is restricted.\n\nHTTPS is now supported as a connection type in Environments.\n\n[baileympearson](https://github.com/baileympearson)\\\n[h40huynh](https://github.com/h40huynh)\\\n[Ankit-69k](https://github.com/Ankit-69k)\\\n[francisfontoura](https://github.com/francisfontoura)\\\n[iocanel](https://github.com/iocanel)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.114.2...n8n@1.114.3) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-10-06\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.114.1...n8n@1.114.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-10-02\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.114.0...n8n@1.114.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-10-02\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.113.0...n8n@1.114.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-09-29\n\nThis release contains core updates, editor improvements, project updates, performance improvements, and bug fixes.\n\n[nealzhu3](https://github.com/nealzhu3)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.113.2...n8n@1.113.3) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-09-26\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.112.5...n8n@1.112.6) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-09-26\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.113.1...n8n@1.113.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-09-24\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n### Python task runner\n\nThis version introduces the **Python task runner** as a beta feature. This feature secures n8n's Python sandbox and enables users to run real Python modules in n8n workflows. The original Pyodide-based implementation will be phased out.\n\nThis is a **breaking change** that replaces Pyodide - see [here](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/#python-native-beta) for a list of differences. Any Code node set to the legacy `python` parameter will need to be manually updated to use the new `pythonNative` parameter. Any Code node script set to `python` and relying on Pyodide syntax is likely to need to be manually adjusted to account for breaking changes.\n\n- For self-hosting users, see [here](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/task-runners/#setting-up-external-mode) for deployment instructions for task runners going forward and how to install extra dependencies.\n- On n8n Cloud, this will be a gradual transition. If in your n8n Cloud instance the Code node offers an option named \"Python (Native) (Beta)\", then your instance has been transitioned to native Python and you will need to look out for any breaking changes. Imports are disabled for security reasons at this time.\n\nThe native Python runner is currently in beta and is subject to change as we find a balance between security and usability. Your feedback is welcome.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.112.4...n8n@1.112.5) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-09-24\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.113.0...n8n@1.113.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-09-23\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nWe’re excited to introduce **data tables**, bringing built-in data storage to n8n. You can now store and query structured data directly inside the platform, without relying on external databases for many common automation scenarios. Track workflow state between runs, store tokens or session data, keep product or customer reference tables, or stage intermediate results for multi-step processes.\n\nPreviously, persisting data meant provisioning and connecting to an external store such as Redis or Google Sheets. That added credential setup, infrastructure overhead, latency, and constant context switching. **Data tables** eliminate that friction and keeps your data easily editable and close to your workflows.\n\nData tables are available today on all plans. They currently support numbers, strings, and datetimes with JSON support coming soon. On Cloud, each instance can store up to 50 MB. On self-hosted setups, the default is also 50 MB, but this limit can be adjusted if your infrastructure allows.\n\n[Overview of data tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkiIkt6lZ4)\n\n**Create a data table**\n\n- From the canvas, open the **Create workflow** dropdown and select **Create Data table**.\n- Or, go to the **Overview** panel on the left-side navigation bar and open the **Data tables** tab.\n\n**Use a data table in your workflow**\n\n- Add the **Data table node** to your workflow to get, update, insert, upsert, or delete rows.\n\n**Adjust the storage limit** (self-hosted only)\n\n- Change the default 50 MB limit with the environment variable: `N8N_DATA_TABLES_MAX_SIZE_BYTES`. [See configuration docs](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/).\n\n- Data tables don’t currently support foreign keys or default values.\n- For now, all data tables are accessible to everyone in a project. More granular permissions and sharing options are planned.\n\nLearn more about [**data tables**](../data/data-tables/) and the [**Data table node**](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datatable/).\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.112.3...n8n@1.112.4) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-09-23\n\nThis release contains an editor improvement.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.112.0...n8n@1.113.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-09-22\n\nThis release contains core updates, editor improvements, a new node, node updates, and bug fixes.\n\nWe’ve made updates to strengthen Single Sign-On (SSO) reliability and security, especially for enterprise and multi-instance setups.\n\n- OIDC and SAML sync in multi-main setups \\[version: 1.113.0\\]: In multi-main deployments, updates to SSO settings are now synchronized across all instances, ensuring consistent login behavior everywhere.\n- Enhanced OIDC integration \\[version 1.111.0\\]: n8n now supports OIDC providers that enforce state and nonce parameters. These are validated during login, providing smoother and more secure Single Sign-On.\n\n### Filter insights by project\n\nWe've added project filtering to insights, enabling more granular reporting and visibility into individual project performance.\n\n[ongdisheng](https://github.com/ongdisheng)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on

Executions API:\n\n- Execution details: `GET /executions` now includes *status* and *workflow_name* in the response.\n- Retry execution endpoint: Added new public API endpoints to retry failed executions.\n- Additional filters: You can now filter executions by running or canceled status.\n\n### Enhancements to workflow diff\n\nWe added a several updates on workflows diffs as well:\n\n- Better view in Code nodes and Stickies: Workflow diffs now highlight changes per line instead of per block, making edits easier to review and understand.\n- Enable/Disable sync: You can now enable or disable sync in the viewport, letting you compare a workflow change in one view without affecting the other.\n\n[GuraaseesSingh](https://github.com/GuraaseesSingh)\\\n[jabbson](https://github.com/jabbson)\\\n[ongdisheng](https://github.com/ongdisheng)\n\nFor full release details, refer to

performance improvements, and bug fixes.\n\nFor teams working across different environments, deployments often involve multiple people making changes at different times. Without a clear view of those changes, it’s easy to miss something important.\n\n[Workflow Diff](../source-control-environments/using/compare-changes/) gives you an easy and visual way to review workflow changes before you deploy them between environments.\n\n- Quickly see what’s been added, changed, or deleted, with clear colour highlights.\n- Easily see important settings changes on a workflow.\n- Check changes inside each node, and spot connector updates, with a side-by-side view of its settings.\n- Get a quick count of all changes to understand the size of a deployment.\n\nWorkflow Diff eases the review and approval of changes before deployment, enabling teams to collaborate on workflows without breaking existing automations or disrupting production. It’s one step further in integrating DevOps best practices in n8n.\n\nNow available for Enterprise customers using Environments.\n\n[ManuLasker](https://github.com/ManuLasker)\\\n[EternalDeiwos](https://github.com/EternalDeiwos)\\\n[jreyesr](https://github.com/jreyesr)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.107.1...n8n@1.107.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-08-15\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.107.0...n8n@1.107.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-08-14\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.106.2...n8n@1.106.3) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-08-11\n\nThis release contains a backported update.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.106.0...n8n@1.107.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-08-11\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\n[Amsal1](https://github.com/Amsal1)\\\n[andrewzolotukhin](https://github.com/andrewzolotukhin)\\\n[DMA902](https://github.com/DMA902)\\\n[fkowal](https://github.com/fkowal)\\\n[Gulianrdgd](https://github.com/Gulianrdgd)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.106.1...n8n@1.106.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-08-08\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.106.0...n8n@1.106.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-08-07\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.105.3...n8n@1.105.4) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-08-07\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.105.2...n8n@1.105.3) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-08-05\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.105.0...n8n@1.106.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-08-04\n\nThis release contains performance improvements, core updates, editor improvements, node updates, a new node, and bug fixes.\n\n### **No more limit of active workflows and new self-hosted Business Plan**\n\nWe have rolled out a new pricing model to make it easier for builders of all sizes to adopt and scale automation with n8n.\n\n**No more limit of active workflows.**\n\nAll n8n plans, from Starter to Enterprise, now include unlimited users, workflows, and steps. Our pricing is based on the volume of executions. Meaning you can build and test as many workflows as you want, including complex, data-heavy, or long-running automations, without worrying about quotas.\n\n**New self-hosted Business Plan for growing teams**\n\nDesigned for SMBs and mid-sized companies, the Business Plan includes features such as:\n\n- 6 shared projects\n- SSO, SAML and LDAP\n- Different environments\n- Global variables\n- Version control using Git\n- 30 days of Insights\n\nPlease note that this plan only includes support from our community forum. For dedicated support we recommend upgrading to our Enterprise plan.\n\n**Enterprise pricing now scales with executions**\n\nEnterprise plans no longer use workflow-based pricing, and is now also based on the volume of executions.\n\n***What you need to do***\n\nTo ensure these changes apply to your account, update your n8n instance to the latest version.\n\n[Read the blog](https://blog.n8n.io/build-without-limits-everything-you-need-to-know-about-n8ns-new-pricing/) for full details.\n\n[baruchiro](https://github.com/baruchiro)\\\n[killthekitten](https://github.com/killthekitten)\\\n[baileympearson](https://github.com/baileympearson)\\\n[Yingrjimsch](https://github.com/Yingrjimsch)\\\n[joshualipman123](https://github.com/joshualipman123)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.105.1...n8n@1.105.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-08-01\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.105.0...n8n@1.105.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-08-01\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.104.1...n8n@1.104.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-07-31\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.104.0...n8n@1.105.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-07-28\n\nThis release contains core updates, editor improvements, node updates, and bug fixes.\n\n### **Respond to Chat node**\n\nWith the [\\*\\*Respond to Chat](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.respondtochat/) node\\*\\*, you can now access Human-in-the-Loop functionality natively in n8n Chat.\n\nEnable conversational experiences where you can ask for clarification, request approval before taking further action, and get back intermediate results — all within a single workflow execution.\n\nThis unlocks multi-turn interactions that feel more natural and reduce the number of executions required.

It feels faster, smoother, and more like what people expect from chat experiences.\n\nStreaming is available in public chat views (hosted or embedded) and can be used in custom apps via webhook.\n\nConfigure streaming in the Node Details View of these nodes:\n\n- Chat Trigger node: Options>Add Field>Response Mode>Streaming\n- Webhook node: Respond>Streaming\n- AI Agent node: Add option> Enable streaming\n\n[](/_video/release-notes/streaming.webm)\n\n### Improved instance user list with more visibility\n\nThe instance user list has been updated with a new table layout and additional details to help admins manage access more easily.\n\n- See total users and filter by name or email\n- View which projects each user has access to\n- Whether a user has enabled 2FA and sort based on that\n- See the last active date for each user\n\nThis makes it easier to audit user activity, identify inactive accounts, and understand how access is distributed across your instance.\n\n### Webhook HTML responses\n\nStarting with this release, if your workflow sends an HTML response to a webhook, n8n automatically wraps the content in an `<iframe>`. This is a security mechanism to protect the instance users.\n\nThis has the following implications:\n\n- HTML renders in a sandboxed iframe instead of directly in the parent document.\n- JavaScript code that attempts to access the top-level window or local storage will fail.\n- Authentication headers aren't available in the sandboxed iframe (for example, basic auth). You need to use an alternative approach, like embedding a short-lived access token within the HTML.\n- Relative URLs (for example, `<form action=\"/\">`) won't work. Use absolute URLs instead.\n\n### Built-in Metrics for AI Evaluations\n\nUsing evaluations is a best practice for any AI solution, and a must if reliability and predictability are business-critical. With this release, we’ve made it easier to set up evaluations in n8n by introducing a set of built-in metrics. These metrics can review AI responses and assign scores based on factors like correctness, helpfulness, and more.\n\nYou can run regular evaluations and review scores over time as a way to monitor your AI workflow's performance. You can also compare results across different models to help guide model selection, or run evaluations before and after a prompt change to support data-driven, iterative building.\n\nAs with all evaluations in n8n, you’ll need a dataset that includes the inputs you want to test. For some evaluations, the dataset must also include expected outputs (ground truth) to compare against. The evaluation workflow runs each input through the portion you're testing to generate a response. The built-in metric scores each response based on the aspect you're measuring, allowing you to compare results before and after changes or track trends over time in the Evaluations tab.\n\nYou can still define your own custom metrics, but for common use cases, the built-in options make it much faster to implement.\n\n1. Set up your evaluation as described [here](../advanced-ai/evaluations/metric-based-evaluations/#how-it-works), using an **Evaluation** node as the trigger and another with the **Set Metrics** operation.\n1. In the **Set Metrics** node, choose a metric from the dropdown list.\n1. Define any additional parameters required for your selected metric. In most cases, this includes mapping the dataset columns to the appropriate fields.\n\n📏 **Available built-in metrics:**\n\n- **Correctness (AI-based):** Compares AI workflow-generated responses to expected answers. Another LLM acts as a judge, scoring the responses based on guidance you provide in the prompt.\n- **Helpfulness (AI-based):** Evaluates how helpful a response is in relation to a user query, using an LLM and prompt-defined scoring criteria.\n- **String Similarity:** Measures how closely the response matches the expected output by comparing strings. Useful for command generation or when output needs to follow a specific structure.\n- **Categorization:** Checks whether a response matches an expected label, such as assigning items to the correct category.\n- **Tools Used:** Verifies whether the AI agent called the tools you specified in your dataset. To enable this, make sure **Return Intermediate Steps** is turned on in your agent so the evaluation can access the tools it actually called.\n\n- Registered Community Edition enables analysis of one evaluation in the **Evaluations** tab which allows easy comparison of evaluation runs over time. Pro and Enterprise plans allow unlimited evaluations in the **Evaluations** tab.\n\n[Learn more](../advanced-ai/evaluations/overview/) about setting up and customizing evaluations.\n\n### AI Agent Tool node\n\nWith the **AI Agent Tool** node we are introducing a simplified pattern for multi-agent orchestration that can be run in a single execution and stay entirely on one canvas. You can now connect multiple **AI Agent Tool** nodes to a primary **AI Agent** node, allowing it to supervise and delegate work across other specialized agents.\n\nThis setup is especially useful for building complex systems that function like real-world teams, where a lead agent assigns parts of a task to specialists. You can even add multiple layers of agents directing other agents, just like you would have in a real multi-tiered organizational structure. It also helps with prompt management by letting you split long, complex instructions into smaller, focused tasks across multiple agents. While similar orchestration was already possible using sub-workflows, AI Agent Tool nodes are a good choice when you want the interaction to happen within a single execution or prefer to manage and debug everything from a single canvas.\n\n- Add an **AI Agent** node to your workflow and click **+** to create a Tools connection.\n- Search for and select the **AI Agent Tool** node from the Nodes Panel.\n- Name the node clearly so the primary agent can reference it, then add a short description and prompt.\n- Connect any LLMs, memory, and tools the agent needs to perform its role.\n- Instruct the primary **AI Agent** on when to use the **AI Agent Tool** and to pass along relevant context in its prompt.\n\n- The orchestrating agent does not pass full execution context by default. Any necessary context must be included in the prompt.\n\n**AI Agent Tool** nodes makes it easier to build layered, agent-to-agent workflows without relying on sub-workflows, helping you move faster when building and debugging multi-agent systems.\n\n[ksg97031](https://github.com/ksg97031)\\\n[israelshenkar](https://github.com/israelshenkar)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.102.1...n8n@1.102.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-07-11\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.101.1...n8n@1.101.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-07-11\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.102.0...n8n@1.102.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-07-09\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.101.0...n8n@1.102.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-07-07\n\nThis release contains core updates, editor improvements, new nodes, node updates, and bug fixes.\n\n### Enforce 2FA across your instance\n\nEnterprise Instance owners can now enforce two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users in their instance.\n\nOnce enabled, any user who hasn’t set up 2FA will be redirected to complete the setup before they can continue using n8n. This helps organizations meet internal security policies and ensures stronger protection across the workspace.\n\nThis feature is available only on the Enterprise plan.\n\n[marty-sullivan](https://github.com/marty-sullivan)\\\n[cesars-gh](https://github.com/cesars-gh)\\\n[dudanogueira](https://github.com/dudanogueira)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.101.0...n8n@1.101.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-07-03\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.100.0...n8n@1.101.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-06-30\n\nThis release contains core updates, editor improvements, node updates, and bug fixes.\n\n[luka-mimi](https://github.com/luka-mimi)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.100.0...n8n@1.100.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-06-25\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.99.0...n8n@1.100.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-06-23\n\nThis release contains core updates, editor improvements, a new node, node updates, and bug fixes.\n\n### Model Selector node\n\nThe [Model Selector node](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.modelselector/) gives you more control when working with multiple LLMs in your workflows.\n\nUse it to determine which connected model should handle a given input, based on conditions like expressions or global variables. This makes it easier to implement model routing strategies, such as switching models based on performance, task type, cost, or availability.\n\n🛠️ **How to:** Connect multiple model nodes to the Model Selector node, then configure routing conditions in the node’s settings.\n\n- Rules are evaluated in order. The first matching rule determines which model is used even if others would also match.\n- As a sub-node, expressions behave differently here: they always resolves to the first item rather than resolving for each item in turn.\n\nThe Model Selector node is especially useful in evaluation or production scenarios where routing logic between models needs to adapt based on performance, cost, availability, or dataset-specific needs.\n\n### Support for OIDC (OpenID Connect) authentication\n\nYou can now use OIDC (OpenID Connect) as an authentication method for Single Sign-On (SSO).\n\nThis gives enterprise teams more flexibility to integrate n8n with their existing identity providers using a widely adopted and easy-to-manage standard. OIDC is now available alongside SAML, giving Enterprises the choice to select what best fits their internal needs.\n\n### Project admins can now commit to Git within environments\n\nProject admins now have the ability to commit workflow and credential changes directly to Git through the environments feature. This update streamlines the workflow deployment process by giving project-level admins direct control over committing their changes. It also ensures that the those who know their workflows best can review and commit updates themselves, without needing to involve instance-level admins.\n\n[Learn more about source control environments](../source-control-environments/)\n\n[aliou](https://github.com/aliou)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.99.0...n8n@1.99.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-06-19\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.98.1...n8n@1.98.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-06-18\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.98.0...n8n@1.99.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-06-16\n\nThis release contains performance improvements, core updates, editor changes, node updates, and bug fixes.\n\n### Automatically name nodes\n\nDefault node names now update automatically based on the resource and operation selected, so you’ll always know what a node does at a glance.\n\nThis adds clarity to your canvas and saves time renaming nodes manually.\n\nDon’t worry, automatic naming won’t break references. And, and if you’ve renamed a node yourself, we’ll leave it just the way you wrote it.\n\n[](/_video/release-notes/automatic_node_naming.mp4)\n\n### Support for RAG extended with built-in templates\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can improve AI responses by providing language models access to data sources with up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge. RAG workflows typically rely on vector stores to manage and search this data efficiently.\n\nTo get the benefits of using vector stores, such as returning results based on semantic meaning rather than just keyword matches, you need a way to upload your data to the vector store and a way to query it.\n\nIn n8n, uploading and querying vectors stores happens in two workflows. Now, you have an example to get your started and make implementation easier with the **RAG starter template**.\n\n- The **Load Data** workflow shows how to add data with the appropriate embedding model, split it into chunks with the [Default Data Loader](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/), and add metadata as desired.\n- The **Retriever** workflow for querying data, shows how agents and vector stores work together to help you define highly relevant results and save tokens using the **Question and Answer** tool.\n\nEnable semantic search and the retrieval of unstructured data for increased quality and relevance of AI responses.\n\n- Search for **RAG starter template** in the search bar of the Nodes panel to insert it into your workflow.\n\nLearn more about implementing RAG in n8n [here](../advanced-ai/rag-in-n8n/).\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.98.0...n8n@1.98.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-06-12\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.97.0...n8n@1.98.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-06-11\n\nThis release contains performance improvements, core updates, editor changes, node updates, a new node, and bug fixes.\n\n[luka-mimi](https://github.com/luka-mimi)\\\n[Alexandero89](https://github.com/Alexandero89)\\\n[khoazero123](https://github.com/khoazero123)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.97.0...n8n@1.97.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-06-04\n\nThis release contains backports.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.95.2...n8n@1.95.3) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-06-03\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.96.0...n8n@1.97.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-06-02\n\nThis release contains new features, performance improvements and bug fixes.\n\n### Convert to sub-workflow\n\nLarge, monolithic workflows can slow things down. They’re harder to maintain, tougher to debug, and more difficult to scale. With sub-workflows, you can take a more modular approach, breaking up big workflows into smaller, manageable parts that are easier to reuse, test, understand, and explain.\n\nUntil now, creating sub-workflows required copying and pasting nodes manually, setting up a new workflow from scratch, and reconnecting everything by hand. **Convert to sub-workflow** allows you to simplify this process into a single action, so you can spend more time building and less time restructuring.\n\n[](/_video/release-notes/convert_to_sub-workflow.mp4)\n\n1. Highlight the nodes you want to convert to a sub-workflow. These must:\n   - Be fully connected, meaning no missing steps in between them\n   - Start from a single starting node\n   - End with a single node\n1. Right-click to open the context menu and select **Convert to sub-workflow**\n   - Or use the shortcut: `Alt + X`\n1. n8n will:\n   - Open a new tab containing the selected nodes\n   - Preserve all node parameters as-is\n   - Replace the selected nodes in the original workflow with a **Call My Sub-workflow** node\n\n*Note*: You will need to manually adjust the field types in the Start and Return nodes in the new sub-workflow.\n\nThis makes it easier to keep workflows modular, performant, and easier to maintain.\n\nLearn more about [sub-workflows](../flow-logic/subworkflows/).\n\nThis release contains performance improvements and bug fixes.\n\n[maatthc](https://github.com/maatthc)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.95.0...n8n@1.96.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-06-02\n\nThis release failed to build.

This includes:\n\n- Assigning existing or pending users to a project with a specific role\n- Updating a user’s role within a project\n- Removing users from one or more projects\n\nThis update now allows you to use the API to add users to both the instance and specific projects, removing the need to manually assign them in the UI.\n\n### Add pending users to project member assignment\n\nYou can now add **pending users,** those who have been invited but haven't completed sign-up, to projects as members.\n\nThis change lets you configure a user's project access upfront, without waiting for them to finish setting up their account. It eliminates the back-and-forth of managing access post-sign-up, ensuring users have the right project roles immediately upon joining.\n\n[matthabermehl](https://github.com/matthabermehl)\\\n[Stamsy](https://github.com/Stamsy)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.95.1...n8n@1.95.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-05-29\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.95.0...n8n@1.95.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-05-27\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.94.0...n8n@1.94.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-05-27\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.94.0...n8n@1.95.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-05-26\n\nThis release contains core updates, editor improvements, node updates, and bug fixes.\n\n### Evaluations for AI workflows\n\nWe’ve added a feature to help you iterate, test, and compare changes to your AI automations before pushing them to production so you can achieve more predictability and make better decisions.\n\nWhen you're building with AI, a small prompt tweak or model swap might improve results with some inputs, while quietly degrading performance with others. But without a way to evaluate performance across many inputs, you’re left guessing whether your AI is actually getting better when you make a change.\n\nBy implementing **Evaluations for AI workflows** in n8n, you can assess how your AI performs across a range of inputs by adding a dedicated path in your workflow for running test cases and applying custom metrics to track results. This helps you build viable proof-of-concepts quickly, iterate more effectively, catch regressions early, and make more confident decisions when your AI is in production.\n\n#### Evaluation node and tab\n\nThe **Evaluation node** includes several operations that, when used together, enable end-to-end AI evaluation.\n\n- Run your AI logic against a wide range of test cases in the same execution\n- Capture the outputs of those test cases\n- Score the results using your own metrics or LLM-as-judge logic\n- Isolate a testing path to only include the nodes and logic you want to evaluate\n\nThe **Evaluations tab** enables you to review test results in the n8n UI, perfect for comparing runs, spotting regressions, and viewing performance over time.\n\n#### 🛠 How evaluations work\n\nThe evaluation path runs alongside your normal execution logic and only activates when you want—making it ideal for testing and iteration.\n\nGet started by selecting an AI workflow you want to evaluate that includes one or more LLM or Agent nodes.\n\n1. Add an **Evaluation** node with the **On new Evaluation event** operation. This node will act as an additional trigger you’ll run only when testing. Configure it to read your dataset from Google Sheets, with each row representing a test input.\n\n> 💡 Better datasets mean better evaluations. Craft your dataset from a variety of test cases, including edge cases and typical inputs, to get meaningful feedback on how your AI performs. Learn more and access sample datasets [here](../advanced-ai/evaluations/light-evaluations/#1-create-a-dataset).\n\n1. Add a second **Evaluation** node using the **Set Outputs** operation after the part of the workflow you're testing—typically after an LLM or Agent node. This captures the response and writes it back to your dataset in Google Sheets.\n\n1. To evaluate output quality, add a third **Evaluation** node with the **Set Metrics** operation at a point after you’ve generated the outputs. You can develop workflow logic, custom calculations, or add an LLM-as-Judge to score the outputs. Map these metrics to your dataset in the node’s parameters.\n\n> 💡 Well-defined metrics = smarter decisions. Scoring your outputs based on similarity, correctness, or categorization can help you track whether changes are actually improving performance. Learn more and get links to example templates [here](../advanced-ai/evaluations/metric-based-evaluations/#2-add-metrics-to-workflow).\n\nWhen the Evaluation trigger node is executed, it runs each input in our dataset through your AI logic. This continues until all test cases are processed, a limit is reached, or you manually stop the execution. Once your evaluation path is set up, you can update your prompt, model, or workflow logic—and re-run the Evaluation trigger node to compare results. If you’ve added metrics, they’ll appear in the Evaluations tab.\n\nIn some instances, you may want to isolate your testing path to make iteration faster or to avoid executing downstream logic. In this case, you can add an Evaluation node with the `Check If Evaluating` operation to ensure only the expected nodes run when performing evaluations.\n\n#### Things to keep in mind\n\nEvaluations for AI Workflows are designed to fit into your development flow, with more enhancements on the way. For now, here are a few things to note:\n\n- Test datasets are currently managed through Google Sheets. You’ll need a Google Sheets credential to run evaluations.\n- Each workflow supports one evaluation at a time. If you’d like to test multiple segments, consider splitting them into sub-workflows for more flexibility.\n- Community Edition supports one single evaluation. Pro and Enterprise plans allow unlimited evaluations.\n- AI Evaluations are not enabled for instances in scaling mode at this time.\n\nYou can find details, tips, and common troubleshooting info [here](../advanced-ai/evaluations/tips-and-common-issues/).\n\n👉 Learn more about the AI evaluation strategies and practical implementation techniques.

Now you can access a select set of community nodes and partner integrations without leaving the canvas. This means you install and automate with a wider range of integrations without leaving your workspace. The power of the community is now built-in.\n\nThis update focuses on three major improvements:\n\n- **Cloud availability**: Community nodes are no longer just for self-hosted users. A select set of nodes is now available on n8n Cloud.\n- **Built-in discovery**: You can find and explore these nodes right from the Nodes panel without leaving the editor or searching on npm.\n- **Trust and verification**: Nodes that appear in the editor have been manually vetted for quality and security. These verified nodes are marked with a checkmark.\n\nWe’re starting with a selection of around 25 nodes, including some of the most-used community-built packages and partner-supported integrations. For this phase, we focused on nodes that don’t include external package dependencies - helping streamline the review process and ensure a smooth rollout.\n\nThis is just the start. We plan to expand the library gradually, bringing even more verified nodes into the editor along with the powerful and creative use cases they unlock. In time, our criteria will evolve, opening the door to a wider range of contributions while keeping quality and security in focus.\n\nLearn more about this update and find out which nodes are already installable from the editor in our [blog](https://blog.n8n.io/community-nodes-available-on-n8n-cloud/) post.\n\n💻 **Use a verified node**\n\nMake sure you're on **n8n version 1.94.0** or later and the instance Owner has enabled verified community nodes. On Cloud, this can be done from the Admin Panel. For self-hosted instances, please refer to [documentation](../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes/). In both cases, verified nodes are enabled by default.\n\n- Open the **Nodes panel** from the editor\n- Search for the Node. Verified nodes are indicated by a shield 🛡️\n- Select the node and click **Install**\n\n[](/_video/release-notes/Community-nodes-node-panel.mp4)\n\nOnce an Owner installs a node, everyone on the instance can start using it—just drag, drop, and connect like any other node in your workflow.\n\n🛠️ **Build a node and get it verified**\n\nWant your node to be verified and discoverable from the editor? Here’s how to get involved:\n\n1. Review the [community node verification guidelines](../integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/verification-guidelines/).\n1. If you’re building something new, follow the recommendations for [creating nodes](../integrations/creating-nodes/overview/).\n1. Check your design against the [UX guidelines](../integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ux-guidelines/).\n1. [Submit your node](../integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes/) to npm.\n1. Request verification by filling out [this form](https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/form/f0ff9304-f34a-420e-99da-6103a2f8ac5b).\n\n**Already built a node? Raise your hand!**\n\nIf you’ve already published a community node and want it considered for verification, make sure it meets the requirements noted above, then let us know by submitting the interest [form](https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/form/f0ff9304-f34a-420e-99da-6103a2f8ac5b). We’re actively curating the next batch and would love to include your work.\n\n### Extended logs view\n\nWhen workflows get complex, debugging can get... clicky. That’s where an extended **Logs View** comes in. Now you can get a clearer path to trace executions, troubleshoot issues, and understand the behavior of a complete workflow — without bouncing between node detail views.\n\nThis update brings a unified, always-accessible panel to the bottom of the canvas, showing you each step of the execution as it happens. Whether you're working with loops, sub-workflows, or AI agents, you’ll see a structured view of everything that ran, in the order it ran—with input, output, and status info right where you need it.\n\nYou can jump into node details when you want to dig deeper, or follow a single item through every step it touched. Real-time highlighting shows you which nodes are currently running or have failed, and you’ll see total execution time for any workflow—plus token usage for AI workflows to help monitor performance. And if you're debugging across multiple screens? Just pop the logs out and drag them wherever you’d like.\n\n- Adds a **Logs view** to the bottom of the canvas that can be opened or collapsed. (Chat also appears here if your workflow uses it).\n- Displays a **hierarchical list of nodes** in the order they were executed—including expanded views of sub-workflows.\n- Allows you to **click a node in hierarchy** to preview inputs and outputs directly, or jump into the full Node Details view with a link.\n- Provides ability to **toggle** input and output data on and off.\n- Highlights each node **live as it runs**, showing when it starts, completes, or fails.\n- Includes **execution history** view to explore past execution data in a similar way.\n- Shows **roll-up stats** like total execution time and total AI tokens used (for AI-enabled workflows).\n- Includes a **“pop out”** button to open the logs as a floating window—perfect for dragging to another screen while debugging.\n\nTo access the expanded logs view, click on the Logs bar at the bottom of the canvas. The view is also opens up when you open the chat window on the bottom of the page.\n\n[Stamsy](https://github.com/Stamsy)\\\n[feelgood-interface](https://github.com/feelgood-interface)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.92.0...n8n@1.93.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-05-12\n\nThis release contains core updates, editor improvements, new nodes, node updates, and bug fixes.\n\n### Faster ways to open sub-workflows\n\nWe’ve added several new ways to navigate your multi-workflow automations faster.\n\nFrom any workflow with a sub-workflow node:\n\n🖱️ Right-click on a sub-workflow node and select `Open sub-workflow` from the context menu\n\n⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts\n\n- **Windows:** `CTRL + SHIFT + O` or `CTRL + Double Click`\n- **Mac:** `CMD + SHIFT + O` or `CMD + Double Click`\n\nThese options will bring your sub-workflow up in a new tab.\n\n### Archive workflows\n\nIf you’ve ever accidentally removed a workflow, you’ll appreciate the new archiving feature. Instead of permanently deleting workflows with the Remove action, workflows are now archived by default. This allows you to recover them if needed.\n\n- **Archive a workflow** - Select **Archive** from the Editor UI menu. It has replaced the **Remove** action.\n- **Find archived workflows** - Archived workflows are hidden by default. To find your archived workflows, select the option for **Show archived workflows** in the workflow filter menu.\n- **Permanently delete a workflow** - Once a workflow is archived, you can **Delete** it from the options menu.\n- **Recover a workflow** - Select **Unarchive** from the options menu.\n\n- Workflows archival requires the same permissions as required previously for removal.\n- You cannot select archived workflows as sub-workflows to execute\n- Active workflows are deactivated when they are archived\n- Archived workflows can not be edited\n\n[LeaDevelop](https://github.com/LeaDevelop)\\\n[ayhandoslu](https://github.com/ayhandoslu)\\\n[valentina98](https://github.com/valentina98)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.92.1...n8n@1.92.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-05-08\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.91.2...n8n@1.91.3) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-05-08\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.92.0...n8n@1.92.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-05-06\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.91.0...n8n@1.92.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-05-05\n\nThis release contains core updates, editor improvements, node updates, and bug fixes.\n\n### Partial Execution for AI Tools\n\nWe’ve made it easier to build and iterate on AI agents in n8n. You can now run and test specific tools without having to execute the entire agent workflow.\n\nPartial execution is especially useful when refining or troubleshooting parts of your agent logic. It allows you to test changes incrementally, without triggering full agent runs, reducing unnecessary AI calls, token usage, and downstream activity. This makes iteration faster, more cost-efficient, and more precise when working with complex or multi-step AI workflows.\n\nPartial execution for AI tools is available now for all tools - making it even easier to build, test, and fine-tune AI agents in n8n.\n\n[](/_video/release-notes/AI-agent-partial-execution.mp4)\n\nTo use this feature you can either:\n\n- Click the **Play** button on the tool you want to execute directly from the canvas view.\n- Open the tool’s **Node Details View** and select **\"Execute Step\"** to run it from there.\n\nIf you have previously run the workflow, the input and output will be prefilled with data from the last execution. A pop-up form will open where you can manually fill in the parameters before executing your test.\n\n### Extended logs view\n\nWhen workflows get complex, debugging can get... clicky.

You can now filter insights over a variety of time periods, from the last 24 hours up to 1 year. Pro users are limited to 7 day and 14 day views.\n- **Hourly granularity**. Drill down into the last 24 hours of production executions with hourly granularity, making it easier to analyze workflows and quickly identify issues.\n\nThese updates provide deeper visibility into workflow history, helping you uncover trends over longer periods and detect problems sooner with more precise reporting.\n\n[Stamsy](https://github.com/Stamsy)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.91.1...n8n@1.91.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-05-05\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.90.2...n8n@1.90.3) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-05-05\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.91.0...n8n@1.91.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-05-01\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.90.0...n8n@1.91.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-04-28\n\nThis release contains core updates, editor improvements, node updates, and bug fixes.\n\n### Breadcrumb view from the canvas\n\nWe’ve added **breadcrumb navigation directly on the canvas**, so you can quickly navigate to any of a workflow’s parent folders right from the canvas.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.90.1...n8n@1.90.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-04-25\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.90.0...n8n@1.90.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-04-22\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.89.0...n8n@1.90.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-04-22\n\nThis release contains core updates, editor updates, node updates, performance improvements, and bug fixes.\n\n### Extended HTTP Request tool functionality\n\nWe’ve brought the full power of the HTTP Request node to the HTTP Request tool in AI workflows. That means your AI Agents now have access to all the advanced configuration options—like Pagination, Batching, Timeout, Redirects, Proxy support, and even cURL import.\n\n[](/_video/release-notes/http-request-tool.mp4)\n\nThis update also includes support for the `$fromAI` function to dynamically generate the right parameters based on the context of your prompt — making API calls smarter, faster, and more flexible than ever.\n\n- Open your AI Agent node in the canvas.\n- Click the **‘+’ icon** to add a new tool connection.\n- In the **Tools panel**, select HTTP **Request Tool.**\n- Configure it just like you would a regular **HTTP Request node** — including advanced options\n\n👉 Learn more about configuring the [HTTP Request tool](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/).\n\nUsers on the Enterprise plan can now create API keys with specific scopes to control exactly what each key can access.\n\nPreviously, API keys had full read/write access across all endpoints. While sometimes necessary, this level of access can be excessive and too powerful for most use cases. Scoped API keys allow you to limit access to only the resources and actions a service or user actually needs.\n\nWhen creating a new API key, you can now:\n\n- Select whether the key has read, write, or both types of access.\n- Specify which resources the key can interact with.\n\nSupported scopes include:\n\n- Variables — list, create, delete\n- Security audit — generate reports\n- Projects — list, create, update, delete\n- Executions — list, read, delete\n- Credentials — list, create, update, delete, move\n- Workflows — list, create, update, delete, move, add/remove tags\n\nScoped API keys give you more control and security. You can limit access to only what’s needed, making it safer to work with third parties and easier to manage internal API usage.\n\n### Drag and Drop in Folders\n\nFolders just got friendlier. With this release, you can now **drag and drop workflows and folders** — making it even easier to keep things tidy.\n\nNeed to reorganize? Just select a workflow or folder and drag it into another folder or breadcrumb location. It’s a small change that makes a big difference when managing a growing collection of workflows.\n\n[](/_video/release-notes/Drag-and-drop-folders.mp4)\n\n📁 Folders are available to all [registered](../hosting/community-edition-features/#registered-community-edition) users—jump in and get your workspace in order!\n\n[Zordrak](https://github.com/Zordrak)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.89.1...n8n@1.89.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-04-16\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.89.0...n8n@1.89.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-04-15\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.88.0...n8n@1.89.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-04-14\n\nThis release contains API updates, core updates, editor updates, a new node, node updates, and bug fixes.\n\nWe're rolling out [Insights](../insights/), a new dashboard to monitor how your workflows are performing over time.

Many providers - both established or new - are adopting MCP as a standard way to build agentic systems. It is an easy way to either expose your own app as a server, making capabilities available to a model as tools, or as a client that can call on tools outside of your own system.\n\nWhile it’s still early in the development process, we want to give you access to our new MCP nodes. This will help us understand your requirements better and will also let us converge on a great general solution quicker.\n\nWe are adding two new nodes:\n\n- a MCP [Server Trigger](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcptrigger/) for any workflow\n- a MCP [Client Tool](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolmcp/) for the AI Agent\n\nThe MCP Server Trigger turns n8n into an MCP server, providing n8n tools to models running outside of n8n. You can run multiple MCP servers from your n8n instance. The MCP Client Tool connects LLMs - and other intelligent agents - to any MCP-enabled service through a single interface.\n\nMax from our DevRel team created an official walkthrough for you to get started:\n\n[Studio Update #04](https://youtu.be/45WPU7P-1QQ?feature=shared)\n\n### MCP Server Trigger\n\nThe MCP Server Trigger turns n8n into an MCP server, providing n8n tools to models running outside of n8n. The node acts as an entry point into n8n for MCP clients. It operates by exposing a URL that MCP clients can interact with to access n8n tools. This means your n8n workflows and integrations are now available to models run elsewhere. Pretty neat.\n\n[Explore the MCP Server Trigger docs](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcptrigger/)\n\nThe MCP Client Tool node is a MCP client, allowing you to use the tools exposed by an external MCP server. You can connect the MCP Client Tool node to your models to call external tools with n8n agents. In this regard it is similar to using a n8n tool with your AI agent. One advantage is that the MCP Client Tool can access multiple tools on the MCP server at once, keeping your canvas cleaner and easier to understand.\n\n[Explore the MCP Client Tool docs](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolmcp/)\n\n- Added a node for Azure Cosmos DB\n- Added a node for Milvus Vector Store\n- Updated the Email Trigger (IMAP) node\n\n[adina-hub](https://github.com/adina-hub)\\\n[umanamente](https://github.com/umanamente)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.87.1...n8n@1.87.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-04-09\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.86.0...n8n@1.86.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-04-09\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.87.0...n8n@1.87.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-04-08\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.86.0...n8n@1.87.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-04-07\n\nThis release contains new nodes, node updates, API updates, core updates, editor updates, and bug fixes.\n\n[cesars-gh](https://github.com/cesars-gh)\\\n[Stamsy](https://github.com/Stamsy)\\\n[Pash10g](https://github.com/Pash10g)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.85.0...n8n@1.86.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-31\n\nThis release contains API updates, core updates, editor improvements, node updates, and bug fixes.\n\n[Aijeyomah](https://github.com/Aijeyomah)\\\n[ownerer](https://github.com/ownerer)\\\n[ulevitsky](https://github.com/ulevitsky)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.85.3...n8n@1.85.4) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-27\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.84.2...n8n@1.84.3) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-27\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.84.1...n8n@1.84.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-26\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.85.2...n8n@1.85.3) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-26\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.85.1...n8n@1.85.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-25\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.85.0...n8n@1.85.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-25\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.84.0...n8n@1.85.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-24\n\nThis release contains a new node, a new credential, core updates, editor updates, node updates, and bug fixes.\n\nWhat can we say about folders? Well, they’re super handy for categorizing just about everything and they’re finally available for your n8n workflows. Tidy up your workspace with unlimited folders and nested folders. Search for workflows within folders. It’s one of the ways we’re making it easier to organize your n8n instances more effectively.\n\nCreate and manage folders within your personal space or within projects. You can also create workflows from within a folder. You may need to restart your instance in order to activate folders.\n\nIt's a folder alright\n\nFolders are available for all [registered](../hosting/community-edition-features/#registered-community-edition) users so get started with decluttering your workspace now and look for more features (like drag and drop) to organize your instances soon.\n\n### Enhancements to Form Trigger Node\n\nRecent updates to the Form Trigger node have made it a more powerful tool for building business solutions. These enhancements provide more flexibility and customization, enabling teams to create visually engaging and highly functional workflows with forms.\n\n- **HTML customization:** Add custom HTML to forms, including embedded images and videos, for richer user experiences.\n- **Custom CSS support**: Apply custom styles to user-facing components to align forms with your brand’s look and feel. Adjust fonts, colors, and spacing for a seamless visual identity.\n- **Form previews:** Your form’s description and title will pull into previews of your form when sharing on social media or messaging apps, providing a more polished look.\n- **Hidden fields:** Use query parameters to add hidden fields, allowing you to pass data—such as a referral source—without exposing it to the user.\n- **New responses options:** Respond to user submissions in multiple ways including text, HTML, or a downloadable file (binary format). This enables forms to display rich webpages or deliver digital assets such as dynamically generated invoices or personalized certificates.\n\nForm with custom CSS applied\n\nThese improvements elevate the Form Trigger node beyond a simple workflow trigger, transforming it into a powerful tool for addressing use cases from data collection and order processing to custom content creation.\n\n[Fank](https://github.com/Fank)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.84.0...n8n@1.84.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-18\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.83.0...n8n@1.84.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-17\n\nThis release contains a new node, node updates, editor updates, and bug fixes.\n\n[Pash10g](https://github.com/Pash10g)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.83.1...n8n@1.83.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-14\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.82.3...n8n@1.82.4) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-14\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.82.2...n8n@1.82.3) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-13\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.83.0...n8n@1.83.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-12\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.82.0...n8n@1.83.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-12\n\nThis release contains bug fixes and an editor update.\n\nSchema Preview lets you view and work with a node’s expected output without executing it or adding credentials, keeping you in flow while building.\n\n- **See expected node outputs instantly.** View schemas for over 100+ nodes to help you design workflows efficiently without extra steps.\n- **Define workflow logic first, take care of credentials later.** Build your end-to-end workflow without getting sidetracked by credential setup.\n- **Avoid unwanted executions when building.** Prevent unnecessary API calls, unwanted data changes, or potential third-party service costs by viewing outputs without executing nodes.\n\n- Add a node with Schema Preview support to your workflow.\n- Open the next node in the sequence - Schema Preview data appears in the Node Editor where you would typically find it in the Schema View.\n- Use Schema Preview fields just like other schema data - drag and drop them into parameters and settings as needed.\n\n[](/_video/release-notes/Schema_preview.mp4)\n\nDon’t forget to add the required credentials before putting your workflow into production.\n\n[pemontto](https://github.com/pemontto)\\\n[Haru922](https://github.com/Haru922)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.82.1...n8n@1.82.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-12\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.82.0...n8n@1.82.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-04\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.81.0...n8n@1.82.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2025-03-03\n\nThis release contains core updates, editor updates, new nodes, node updates, new credentials, credential updates, and bug fixes.\n\nTidy up instantly aligns nodes, centers stickies, untangles connections, and brings structure to your workflows.

consistency across environments\n\nWe added new UX and automatic changes improvements resulting in a better consistency between your staging and production instances.\n\nPreviously, users faced issues like:\n\n- Lack of visibility into required credential updates when pulling changes\n- Incomplete synchronization, where changes — such as deletions — weren’t always applied across environments\n- Confusing commit process, making it unclear what was being pushed or pulled\n\nWe addressed these by:\n\n- Clearly indicating required credential updates when pulling changes\n- Ensuring deletions and other modifications sync correctly across environments\n- Improving commit selection to provide better visibility into what’s being pushed\n\nFor full release details, refer to

This enhancement moves JavaScript code execution to a separate process, improving your workflow execution speed while adding better isolation.\n\nTask runners overview\n\nOur benchmarks show up to 6x improvement in workflow executions using Code nodes - from approximately 6 to 35 executions per second. All these improvements happen under the hood, keeping your Code node experience exactly the same.\n\nThe Task runner comes in two modes:\n\n- Internal mode (default): Perfect for getting started, automatically managing task runners as child processes\n- External mode: For advanced hosting scenarios requiring maximum isolation and security\n\nCurrently, this feature is opt-in and can be enabled using [environment variables](../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/). Once stable, it will become the default execution method for Code nodes.\n\nTo start using Task runners today, [check out the docs](../hosting/configuration/task-runners/).\n\n- [AI Transform node](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aitransform/): We improved the prompt for code generation to transform data\n- [Code node](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/): We added a warning if `pairedItem` is absent or could not be auto mapped\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.70.1...n8n@1.70.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-12-04\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.70.0...n8n@1.70.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-11-29\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.69.0...n8n@1.70.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-11-27\n\nThis release contains node updates, performance improvements and bug fixes.\n\n### New canvas in beta\n\nThe new canvas is now the default setting for all users. It should bring significant performance improvements and adds a handy minimap. As it is still a beta version you can still revert to the previous version with the three dot menu.\n\nWe're looking forward to your feedback. Should you encounter a bug, you will find a handy button to create an issue at the bottom of the new canvas as well.\n\n- We added credential support for [Zabbix](../integrations/builtin/credentials/zabbix/) to the HTTP request node\n- We added new OAuth2 credentials for [Microsoft SharePoint](../integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoft/)\n- The [Slack node](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/#operations) now uses markdown for the approval message when using the `Send and Wait for Approval` operation\n\n[feelgood-interface](https://github.com/feelgood-interface)\\\n[adina-hub](https://github.com/adina-hub)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.68.0...n8n@1.68.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-11-26\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.69.1...n8n@1.69.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-11-26\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.69.0...n8n@1.69.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-11-25\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.68.0...n8n@1.69.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-11-20\n\nThis release contains a new feature, node improvements and bug fixes.\n\n### Sub-workflow debugging\n\nWe made it much easier to debug sub-workflows by improving their accessibility from the parent workflow.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.67.1...n8n@1.68.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-11-13\n\nThis release contains node updates, performance improvements and many bug fixes.\n\n#### New AI agent canvas chat\n\nWe revamped the chat experience for AI agents on the canvas.

If you have set `QUEUE_RECOVERY_INTERVAL`, you can remove it as it no longer has any effect.\n\nThis release contains a new features, new nodes, node enhancements, and bug fixes.\n\n### New node: n8n Form\n\nUse the [n8n Form node](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/) to create user-facing forms with multiple pages. You can add other nodes with custom logic between to process user input. Start the workflow with a [n8n Form Trigger](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/).\n\nA multi-page form with branching\n\nAdditionally you can:\n\n- Set default selections with query parameters\n- Define the form with a JSON array of objects\n- Show a completion screen and redirect to another URL\n\n- [Google Business Profile](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebusinessprofile/) and [Google Business Profile Trigger](../integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebusinessprofiletrigger/): Use these to integrate Google Business Profile reviews and posts with your workflows\n\n- [AI Agent](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): Removed the requirement to add at least one tool\n- [GitHub](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.github/): Added workflows as a resource operation\n- [Structured Output Parser](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/): Added more user-friendly error messages\n\nFor additional security, we improved how we handle multi-factor authentication, hardened config file permissions and introduced JWT for the public API.\n\nFor better performance, we improved how partial executions are handled in loops.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n- [Idan Fishman](https://github.com/idanfishman)\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.64.1...n8n@1.64.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-10-24\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.64.0...n8n@1.64.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-10-21\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.63.4...n8n@1.64.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-10-16\n\nThis release contains a new node, node enhancements, performance improvements and bug fixes.\n\n### Enhanced node: Remove Duplicates\n\nThe [Remove Duplicates node](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/) got a major makeover with the addition of two new operations:\n\n- Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates\n- Clear Deduplication History: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.\n\nThis makes it easier to only process new items from any data source. For example, you can now more easily poll a Google sheet for new entries by `id` or remove duplicate orders from the same customer by comparing their `order date`. The great thing is, you can now do this within **and across** workflow runs.\n\nThe new node for [Gong](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gong/) allows you to get users and calls to process them further in n8n. Very useful for sales related workflows.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n- [Sören Uhrbach](https://github.com/soerenuhrbach)\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.63.3...n8n@1.63.4) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-10-15\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.62.5...n8n@1.62.6) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-10-15\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.63.2...n8n@1.63.3) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-10-15\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.63.1...n8n@1.63.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-10-11\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.62.4...n8n@1.62.5) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-10-11\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.63.0...n8n@1.63.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-10-11\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.62.3...n8n@1.62.4) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-10-11\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.62.3...n8n@1.63.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-10-09\n\n[Breaking change](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md)\n\n- The worker server used to bind to IPv6 by default. It now binds to IPv4 by default.\n- The worker server's `/healthz` used to report healthy status based on database and Redis checks. It now reports healthy status regardless of database and Redis status, and the database and Redis checks are part of `/healthz/readiness`.\n\nWhen is action necessary?\n\n- If you experience a port conflict error when starting a worker server using its default port, set a different port for the worker server with `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_PORT`.\n- If you are relying on database and Redis checks for worker health status, switch to checking `/healthz/readiness` instead of `/healthz`.\n\nThis release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.\n\n- [OpenAI](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/): Added the option to choose between the default memory connector to provide memory to the assistant or to specify a thread ID\n- [Gmail](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) and [Slack](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/): Added custom approval operations to have a human in the loop of a workflow\n\nWe have also optimized the [worker health checks](../hosting/logging-monitoring/monitoring/) (see breaking change above).\n\nEach credential now has a seperate url you can link to. This makes sharing much easier.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n[Pemontto](https://github.com/pemontto)\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.62.2...n8n@1.62.3) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-10-08\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.62.1...n8n@1.62.2) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-10-07\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.61.0...n8n@1.62.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-10-02\n\nThis release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.\n\nWe skipped 1.62.0 and went straight to 1.62.1 with an additional fix.\n\n#### Additional nodes as tools\n\nWe have made additional nodes usable with the [Tools AI Agent node](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/).\n\n[](/_video/release-notes/nodes-as-tools.mp4)\n\nAdditionally, we have added a `$fromAI()` placeholder function to use with tools, allowing you to dynamically pass information from the models to the connected tools. This function works similarly to placeholders used elsewhere in n8n.\n\nBoth of these new features enable you to build even more powerful AI agents by drawing directly from the apps your business uses. This makes integrating LLMs into your business processes even easier than before.\n\n- [Google BigQuery](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebigquery/): Added option to return numeric values as integers and not strings\n- [HTTP Request](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/): Added credential support for Sysdig\n- [Invoice Ninja](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.invoiceninja/): Additional query params for getAll requests\n- [Question and Answer Chain](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/): Added the option to use a custom prompt\n\nDrag and drop insertion on cursor position from schema view is now also enabled for code, SQL and Html fields in nodes.\n\nCustomers with an enterprise license can now rate, tag and highlight execution data in the executions view. To use highlighting, add an [Execution Data Node](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executiondata/) (or Code node) to the workflow to set [custom executions data](../workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/).\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n[Benjamin Roedell](https://github.com/benrobot)\\\n[CodeShakingSheep](https://github.com/CodeShakingSheep)\\\n[manuelbcd](https://github.com/manuelbcd)\\\n[Miguel Prytoluk](https://github.com/mprytoluk)\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.60.1...n8n@1.61.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-09-25\n\nThis release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.\n\n- [Brandfetch](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.brandfetch/): Updated to use the new API\n- [Slack](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/): Made adding or removing the workflow link to a message easier\n\nBig datasets now render faster thanks to virtual scrolling and execution annotations are harder to delete.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.59.3...n8n@1.59.4) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-09-20\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.60.0...n8n@1.60.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-09-20\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.59.3...n8n@1.60.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-09-18\n\nThis release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.\n\n#### Queue metrics for workers\n\nYou can now [expose and consume metrics from your workers](../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/prometheus/).

Manual workflow executions now use the same permissions checks as production executions, meaning you can't do a manual execution of a workflow if you don't have access to the credentials. Previously, owners and admins could do manual executions without credentials being shared with them. To resolve this, the credential creator needs to [share the credential](../credentials/credential-sharing/) with you.\n\n#### New feature: Projects\n\nWith projects and roles, you can give your team access to collections of workflows and credentials, rather than having to share each workflow and credential individually. Simultaneously, you tighten security by limiting access to people on the relevant team.\n\nRefer to the [RBAC](../user-management/rbac/) documentation for information on creating projects and using roles.\n\nThe number of projects and role types vary depending on your plan. Refer to [Pricing](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for details.\n\n[](/_video/release-notes/rbac-glimpse.mp4)\n\n#### New node: Slack Trigger\n\nThis release adds a trigger node for Slack. Refer to the [Slack Trigger documentation](../integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/) for details.\n\n- Improved [memory support for OpenAI assistants](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/).\n\n### Rolling back to a previous version\n\nIf you update to this version, then decide you need to role back:\n\n1. Delete any RBAC projects you created.\n1. Revert the database migrations using `n8n db:revert`.\n\nCloud: contact [help@n8n.io](mailto:help@n8n.io).\n\n[Ayato Hayashi](https://github.com/hayashi-ay)\\\n[Daniil Zobov](https://github.com/ddzobov)\\\n[Guilherme Barile](https://github.com/GuilhermeBarile)\\\n[Romain MARTINEAU](https://github.com/RJiraya)\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.42.0...n8n@1.42.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-05-20\n\nThis is a bug fix release.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.41.0...n8n@1.41.1) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-05-16\n\nThis is a bug fix release.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.41.0...n8n@1.42.0) for this version.\\\n**Release date:** 2024-05-15\n\nThis release contains new features, node enhancements, and bug fixes.\n\nNote that this release removes the AI error debugger.
