  "content": "Use the Hugging Face Inference Model node to use Hugging Face's models.\n\nOn this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Hugging Face Inference Model node, and links to more resources.\n\nThis node lacks tools support, so it won't work with the [AI Agent](../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) node. Instead, connect it with the [Basic LLM Chain](../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/) node.\n\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/huggingface/).\n\nParameter resolution in sub-nodes\n\nSub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.\n\nMost nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n- **Model**: Select the model to use to generate the completion.\n\n- **Custom Inference Endpoint**: Enter a custom inference endpoint URL.\n- **Frequency Penalty**: Use this option to control the chances of the model repeating itself. Higher values reduce the chance of the model repeating itself.\n- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.\n- **Presence Penalty**: Use this option to control the chances of the model talking about new topics. Higher values increase the chance of the model talking about new topics.\n- **Sampling Temperature**: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.\n- **Top K**: Enter the number of token choices the model uses to generate the next token.\n- **Top P**: Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n[Browse Hugging Face Inference Model integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/hugging-face-inference-model/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [LangChains's Hugging Face Inference Model documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/huggingface_inference/) for more information about the service.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
