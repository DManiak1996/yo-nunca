  "content": "Follow these steps to configure the IMAP credentials with an Outlook.com account.\n\n## Set up the credentials\n\nTo set up the IMAP credential with Outlook.com account, use these settings:\n\n1. Enter your Outlook.com email address as the **User**.\n\n1. Enter your Outlook.com password as the **Password**.\n\nOutlook.com doesn't require you to use an app password, but if you'd like to for security reasons, refer to [Use an app password](#use-an-app-password).\n\n1. Enter `outlook.office365.com` as the **Host**.\n\n1. For the **Port**, keep the default port number of `993`.\n\n1. Turn on the **SSL/TLS** toggle.\n\n1. Check with your email administrator about whether to **Allow Self-Signed Certificates**.\n\nRefer to Microsoft's [POP, IMAP, and SMTP settings for Outlook.com](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/pop-imap-and-smtp-settings-for-outlook-com-d088b986-291d-42b8-9564-9c414e2aa040) documentation for more information.\n\nYou may receive a connection error if you configured your Outlook.com account as IMAP in multiple email clients. Microsoft is working on a fix for this. For now, try this workaround:\n\n1. Go to [account.live.com/activity](https://account.live.com/activity) and sign in using the email address and password of the affected account.\n1. Under **Recent activity**, find the **Session Type** event that matches the most recent time you received the connection error. Select it to expand the details.\n1. Select **This was me** to approve the IMAP connection.\n1. Retest your n8n credential.\n\nRefer to [What is the Recent activity page?](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/what-is-the-recent-activity-page-23cf5556-4dbe-70da-82c8-bb3a8d8f8016) for more information on using this page.\n\nThe source for these instructions is [Outlook.com IMAP connection errors](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/pop-imap-and-smtp-settings-for-outlook-com-d088b986-291d-42b8-9564-9c414e2aa040). Refer to that documentation for more information.\n\n## Use an app password\n\nIf you'd prefer to use an app password instead of your email account password:\n\n1. Log into the [My Account](https://myaccount.microsoft.com/) page.\n1. If you have a left navigation option for **Security Info**, jump to [Security Info app password](#security-info-app-password). If you don't have an option for **Security Info**, continue with these instructions.\n1. Go to the [Additional security verification page](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/Proofup.aspx).\n1. Select **App passwords** and **Create**.\n1. Enter a **Name** for your app password, like `n8n credential`.\n1. Use the option to **copy password to clipboard** and enter this as the **Password** in n8n instead of your email account password.\n\nRefer to Outlook's [Manage app passwords for 2-step verification](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/manage-app-passwords-for-two-step-verification-d6dc8c6d-4bf7-4851-ad95-6d07799387e9) page for more information.\n\n### Security Info app password\n\nIf you have a left navigation option for **Security Info**:\n\n1. Select **Security Info**. The Security Info page opens.\n1. Select **+ Add method**.\n1. On the **Add a method** page, select **App password** and then select **Add**.\n1. Enter a **Name** for your app password, like `n8n credential`.\n1. Copy the **Password** and enter this as the **Password** in n8n instead of your email account password.\n\nRefer to Outlook's [Create app passwords from the Security info (preview)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/create-app-passwords-from-the-security-info-preview-page-d8bc744a-ce3f-4d4d-89c9-eb38ab9d4137) page for more information.",
