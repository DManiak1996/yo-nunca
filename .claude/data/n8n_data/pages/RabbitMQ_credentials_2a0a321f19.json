  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [RabbitMQ](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.rabbitmq/)\n- [RabbitMQ Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.rabbitmqtrigger/)\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\nRefer to [RabbitMQ's Connections documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/connections) for more information about the service.\n\n## Using user connection\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need to have a [RabbitMQ broker](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) installed and:\n\n1. Enter the **Hostname** for the RabbitMQ broker.\n1. Enter the **Port** the connection should use.\n1. Enter a **User** the connection should use to log in as.\n   - The default is `guest`. RabbitMQ recommends using a different user in production environments. Refer to [Access Control | The Basics](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control#basics) for more information. If you're using the `guest` account with a non-localhost connection, refer to [`guest` user issues](#guest-user-issues) below for troubleshooting tips.\n1. Enter the user's **Password**.\n   - The default password for the `guest` user is `guest`.\n1. Enter the [virtual host](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/vhosts) the connection should use as the **Vhost**. The default virtual host is `/`.\n1. Select whether the connection should use **SSL**. If turned on, also set:\n   - **Passwordless**: Select whether the SSL certificate connection users SASL mechanism EXTERNAL (turned off) or doesn't use a password (turned on). If turned on, you'll also need to enter:\n     - The **Client Certificate**: Paste the text of the SSL client certificate to use.\n     - The **Client Key**: Paste the SSL client key to use.\n     - The **Passphrase**: Paste the SSL passphrase to use.\n   - **CA Certificates**: Paste the text of the SSL CA certificates to use.\n\nIf you use the `guest` user for the credential and you try to access a remote host, you may see a connection error. The RabbitMQ logs show an error like this:\n\nThis happens because RabbitMQ prohibits the default `guest` user from connecting from remote hosts. It can only connect over the `localhost`.\n\nTo resolve this error, you can:\n\n- Update the `guest` user to allow it remote host access.\n- Create or use a different user to connect to the remote host. The `guest` user is the only user limited by default.\n\nRefer to [\"guest\" user can only connect from localhost](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control#loopback-users) for more information.",
