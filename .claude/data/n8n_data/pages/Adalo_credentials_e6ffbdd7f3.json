  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [Adalo](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.adalo/)\n\nYou need a Team or Business plan to use the Adalo APIs.\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\nRefer to [Adalo's API collections documentation](https://help.adalo.com/integrations/the-adalo-api/collections) for more information about working with the service.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need an [Adalo](https://www.adalo.com/) account and:\n\n- An **API Key**\n- An **App ID**\n\nTo get these, create an Adalo app:\n\n1. From the app dropdown in the top navigation, select **CREATE NEW APP**.\n1. Select the App Layout type that makes sense for you and select **Next**.\n   - If you're new to using the product, Adalo recommend using **Mobile Only**.\n1. Select a template to get started with or select **Blank**, then select **Next**.\n1. Enter an **App Name**, like `n8n integration`.\n1. If applicable, select the **Team** for the app.\n1. Select branding colors.\n1. Select **Create**. The app editor opens.\n1. In the left menu, select **Settings** (the gear cog icon).\n1. Select **App Access**.\n1. In the **API Key** section, select **Generate Key**.\n   - If you don't have the correct plan level, you'll see a prompt to upgrade instead.\n1. Copy the key and enter it as the **API Key** in your n8n credential.\n1. The URL includes the **App ID** after `https://app.adalo.com/apps/`. For example, if the URL for your app is `https://app.adalo.com/apps/b78bdfcf-48dc-4550-a474-dd52c19fc371/app-settings`, `b78bdfcf-48dc-4550-a474-dd52c19fc371` is the App ID. Copy this value and enter it in your n8n credential.\n\nRefer to [Creating an app](https://help.adalo.com/design/designing-your-app/creating-an-app) for more information on creating apps in Adalo. Refer to [The Adalo API](https://help.adalo.com/integrations/the-adalo-api) for more information on generating API keys.",
