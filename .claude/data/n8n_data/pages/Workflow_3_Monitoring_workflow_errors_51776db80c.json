  "content": "Last but not least, let's help Nathan know if there are any errors running the workflow.\n\nTo accomplish this task, create an Error workflow that monitors the main workflow:\n\n1. Create a new workflow.\n\n1. Add an **Error Trigger node** (and execute it as a test).\n\n1. Connect a **Discord node** to the **Error Trigger node** and configure these fields:\n\n- **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL that you received in the email from n8n when you signed up for this course.\n\n- **Text**: \"The workflow `{workflow name}` failed, with the error message: `{execution error message}`. Last node executed: `{name of the last executed node}`. Check this workflow execution here: `{execution URL}` My Unique ID: \" followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.\n\nNote that you need to replace the text in curly brackets `{}` with expressions that take the respective information from the Error Trigger node.\n\n1. Execute the Discord node.\n\n1. Set the newly created workflow as the **Error Workflow** for the main workflow you created in the previous lesson.\n\nThe workflow should look like this:\n\n*Workflow 3 for monitoring workflow errors*\n\n- What fields does the **Error Trigger node** return?\n- What information about the execution does the **Error Trigger node** return?\n- What information about the workflow does the **Error Trigger node** return?\n- What's the expression to reference the workflow name?",
