  "content": "Use the Weaviate node to interact with your Weaviate collection as a [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store). You can insert documents into or retrieve documents from a vector database. You can also retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain) or connect this node directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to use as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool). On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Weaviate node, and links to more resources.\n\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/weaviate/).\n\nParameter resolution in sub-nodes\n\nSub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.\n\nMost nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n## Node usage patterns\n\nYou can use the Weaviate Vector Store node in the following patterns.\n\n### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents\n\nYou can use the Weaviate Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Weaviate Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.\n\n### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool\n\nYou can connect the Weaviate Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.\n\nHere, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Weaviate Vector Store node.\n\n### Use a retriever to fetch documents\n\nYou can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Weaviate Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Weaviate Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.\n\n### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions\n\nAnother pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Weaviate Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Weaviate Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.\n\nYou can separate your data into isolated tenants for the same collection (for example, for different customers). For that, you must always provide a [Tenant Name](#tenant-name) both when inserting and retrieving objects. [Read more about multi tenancy in Weaviate docs](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/manage-collections/multi-tenancy).\n\nThis Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.\n\nIn this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt is embedded and used for similarity search. The node returns the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.\n\n#### Insert Documents\n\nUse insert documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.\n\n#### Retrieve Documents (as Vector Store for Chain/Tool)\n\nUse Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.\n\n#### Retrieve Documents (as Tool for AI Agent)\n\nUse Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.\n\n### Get Many parameters\n\n- **Weaviate Collection**: Enter the name of the Weaviate collection to use.\n- **Prompt**: Enter the search query.\n- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.\n\n### Insert Documents parameters\n\n- **Weaviate Collection**: Enter the name of the Weaviate collection to use.\n- **Embedding Batch Size**: The number of documents to embed in a single batch. The default is 200 documents.\n\n### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters\n\n- **Weaviate Collection**: Enter the name of the Weaviate collection to use.\n\n### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters\n\n- **Weaviate Collection**: The name of the vector store.\n- **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.\n- **Weaviate Collection**: Enter the name of the Weaviate collection to use.\n- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.\n\nWhether to include document metadata.\n\nYou can use this with the [Get Many](#get-many) and [Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)](#retrieve-documents-as-tool-for-ai-agent-parameters) modes.\n\nEnables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.\n\nAvailable for the [Get Many](#get-many), [Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)](#retrieve-documents-as-vector-store-for-chaintool), and [Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)](#retrieve-documents-as-tool-for-ai-agent) operation modes.\n\nWhen searching for data, use this to match metadata associated with documents. You can learn more about the operators and query structure in [Weaviate's conditional filters documentation](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/api/graphql/filters#filter-structure).\n\nYou can use both `AND` and `OR` with different operators. Operators are case insensitive:\n\n| Operator           | Required Field(s)                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `'equal'`          | `valueString` or `valueNumber`                       | Checks if the property is equal to the given string or number.                                                                                                                    |\n| `'like'`           | `valueString`                                        | Checks if the string property matches a pattern (for example, sub-string match).                                                                                                  |\n| `'containsAny'`    | `valueTextArray` (string[])                          | Checks if the property contains **any** of the given values.                                                                                                                      |\n| `'containsAll'`    | `valueTextArray` (string[])                          | Checks if the property contains **all** of the given values.                                                                                                                      |\n| `'greaterThan'`    | `valueNumber`                                        | Checks if the property value is greater than the given number.                                                                                                                    |\n| `'lessThan'`       | `valueNumber`                                        | Checks if the property value is less than the given number.                                                                                                                       |\n| `'isNull'`         | `valueBoolean` (true/false)                          | Checks if the property is null or not.

Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.\n\nYou can define which metadata keys you want Weaviate to return on your queries. This can reduce network load, as you will only get properties you have defined. Returns all properties from the server by default.\n\nAvailable for the [Get Many](#get-many), [Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)](#retrieve-documents-as-vector-store-for-chaintool), and [Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)](#retrieve-documents-as-tool-for-ai-agent) operation modes.\n\nThe specific tenant to store or retrieve documents for.\n\nMust enable at creation\n\nYou must pass a tenant name at first ingestion to enable multitenancy for a collection.
