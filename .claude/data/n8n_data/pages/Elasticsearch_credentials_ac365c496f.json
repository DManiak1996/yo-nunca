Enter your Elasticsearch **Username**.\n1. Enter your Elasticsearch **Password**.\n1. In Elasticsearch, go to **Deployments**.\n1. Select your deployment.\n1. Select **Manage this deployment**.\n1. In the **Applications** section, copy the endpoint of the **Elasticsearch** application.\n1. Enter this in n8n as the **Base URL**.\n1. By default, n8n connects only if SSL certificate validation succeeds. If you'd like to connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.\n\nCustom endpoint aliases\n\nIf you add a [custom endpoint alias](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-regional-deployment-aliases.html) to a deployment, update your n8n credential **Base URL** with the new endpoint.",
