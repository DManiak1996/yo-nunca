  "content": "You can manually install community nodes from the npm registry on self-hosted n8n.\n\nYou need to manually install community nodes in the following circumstances:\n\n- Your n8n instance runs in queue mode.\n- You want to install [private packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-private-packages).\n\n## Install a community node\n\nAccess your Docker shell:\n\nCreate `~/.n8n/nodes` if it doesn't already exist, and navigate into it:\n\n## Uninstall a community node\n\nAccess your Docker shell:\n\n## Upgrade a community node\n\nBreaking changes in versions\n\nNode developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes. If you find that an upgrade causes issues, you can [downgrade](#upgrade-or-downgrade-to-a-specific-version).\n\n### Upgrade to the latest version\n\nAccess your Docker shell:\n\n### Upgrade or downgrade to a specific version\n\nAccess your Docker shell:\n\nRun npm uninstall to remove the current version:\n\nRun npm install with the version specified:",
