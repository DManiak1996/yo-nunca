The [Split Out](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/) node.\n\n1. The [AI Transform](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aitransform/) node. For example, try entering something like:\n\n1. The [Code node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).\n\n## Column names were updated after the node's setup\n\nYou'll receive this error if the Google Sheet's column names have changed since you set up the node.\n\nTo refresh the column names, re-select **Mapping Column Mode**. This should prompt the node to fetch the column names again.\n\nOnce the column names refresh, update the node parameters.",
