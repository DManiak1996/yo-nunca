Refer to the [GetResponse Help Center](https://www.getresponse.com/help/where-do-i-find-the-api-key.html) for more detailed instructions.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- A **Client ID**: Generated when you [register your application](https://apidocs.getresponse.com/v3/authentication/oauth2).\n- A **Client Secret**: Generated when you [register your application](https://apidocs.getresponse.com/v3/authentication/oauth2) as the **Client Secret Key**.\n\nWhen you register your application, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and add it as the **Redirect URL** in GetResponse.\n\nRedirect URL with localhost\n\nThe Redirect URL should be a URL in your domain, for example: `https://mytemplatemaker.example.com/gr_callback`.

In your terminal, run the following command:\n\n2. Run the following command in a new terminal. Replace `<YOUR-NGROK-URL>` with the URL that you got from the previous step.\n\n3.
