Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and add this as your **redirect_uri** for the app/client. Use the **client_id** and **client_secret** from the OAuth Client in your n8n credential.\n\nRefer to Pushbullet's [OAuth2 Guide](https://docs.pushbullet.com/#oauth2) for more information.\n\nPushbullet OAuth test link\n\nPushbullet offers a test link during the client creation process described above. This link isn't compatible with n8n. To verify the authentication works, use the **Connect my account** button in n8n.",
