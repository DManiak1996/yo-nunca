  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [Postgres](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/)\n- [Agent](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/)\n- [Postgres Chat Memory](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorypostgreschat/)\n- [PGVector Vector Store](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorepgvector/)\n\nThe Agent node doesn't support SSH tunnels.\n\n[Create a user account](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createuser.html) on a Postgres server.\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\n- Database connection\n\nRefer to [Postgres's documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/index.html) for more information about the service.\n\n## Using database connection\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- The **Host** or domain name for the server.\n- The **Database** name.\n- A **User** name.\n- A user **Password**.\n- **Ignore SSL Issues**: Set whether the credential connects if SSL validation fails.\n- **SSL**: Choose whether to use SSL in your connection.\n- The **Port** number to use for the connection.\n- **SSH Tunnel**: Choose if you want to use SSH to encrypt the network connection with the Postgres server.\n\nTo set up the database connection:\n\n1. Enter the **Host** or domain name for the Postgres server. You can either run the `/conninfo` command to confirm the host name or run this query:\n\n1. Enter the **Database** name. Run the `/conninfo` command to confirm the database name.\n\n1. Enter the **User** name of the user you wish to connect as.\n\n1. Enter the user's **Password**.\n\n1. **Ignore SSL Issues**: If you turn this on, the credential will connect even if SSL validation fails.\n\n1. **SSL**: Choose whether to use SSL in your connection. Refer to Postgres [SSL Support](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/libpq-ssl.html) for more information. Options include:\n\n- **Allow**: Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `allow`. First try a non-SSL connection; if that fails, try an SSL connection.\n   - **Disable**: Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `disable`. Only try a non-SSL connection.\n   - **Require**: Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `require`. Only try an SSL connection. If a root CA file is present, verify that a trusted certificate authority (CA) issued the server certificate.\n\n1. Enter the **Port** number to use for the connection. You can either run the `/conninfo` command to confirm the host name or run this query:\n\n1. **SSH Tunnel**: Turn this setting on to connect to the database over SSH. Refer to [SSH tunnel limitations](#ssh-tunnel-limitations) for some guidance around using SSH. Once turned on, you'll need:\n\n1. Select **SSH Authenticate with** to set the SSH Tunnel type to build:\n      - Select **Password** if you want to connect to SSH using a password.\n      - Select **Private Key** if you want to connect to SSH using an identity file (private key) and a passphrase.\n   1. Enter the remote bind address you're connecting to as the **SSH Host**.\n   1. **SSH Port**: Enter the local port number for the SSH tunnel.\n   1. **SSH Postgres Port**: Enter the remote end of the tunnel, the port number the database server is using.\n   1. **SSH User**: Enter the username to log in as.\n   1. If you selected **Password** for SSH Authenticate with, add the user's **SSH Password**.\n   1. If you selected **Private Key** for **SSH Authenticate with**:\n      1. Add the contents of the **Private Key** or identity file used for SSH.\n      1. If the **Private Key** was created with a passphrase, enter that **Passphrase**. If the **Private Ke**y has no passphrase, leave this field blank.\n\nRefer to [Secure TCP/IP Connections with SSH Tunnels](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/ssh-tunnels.html) for more information.\n\n### SSH tunnel limitations\n\nOnly use the **SSH Tunnel** setting if:\n\n- You're using the credential with the [Postgres](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/) node (Agent node doesn't support SSH tunnels).\n- You have an SSH server running on the same machine as the Postgres server.\n- You have a user account that can log in using `ssh`.",
