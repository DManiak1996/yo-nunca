  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [HTTP Request](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)\n- [HTTP Request Tool (legacy)](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/)\n\nYou must use the authentication method required by the app or service you want to query.\n\nIf you need to secure the authentication with an SSL certificate, refer to [Provide an SSL certificate](#provide-an-ssl-certificate) for the information you'll need.\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\n- Predefined credential type\n- Basic auth (generic credential type)\n- Custom auth (generic credential type)\n- Digest auth (generic credential type)\n- Header auth (generic credential type)\n- Bearer auth (generic credential type)\n- OAuth1 (generic credential type)\n- OAuth2 (generic credential type)\n- Query auth (generic credential type)\n\nRefer to [HTTP authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication) for more information relating to generic credential types.\n\nPredefined credential types\n\nn8n recommends using predefined credential types whenever there's a credential type available for the service you want to connect to. It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.\n\nYou can use [Predefined credential types](../../../custom-operations/#predefined-credential-types) to perform custom operations with some APIs where n8n has a node for the platform. For example, n8n has an Asana node, and supports using your Asana credentials in the HTTP Request node. Refer to [Custom operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.\n\n## Using predefined credential type\n\nTo use a predefined credential type:\n\n1. Open your HTTP Request node, or add a new one to your workflow.\n1. In **Authentication**, select **Predefined Credential Type**.\n1. In **Credential Type**, select the API you want to use.\n1. In **Credential for `<API name>`**, you can:\n   1. Select an existing credential for that platform, if available.\n   1. Select **Create New** to create a new credential.\n\nRefer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports basic authentication.\n\nTo configure this credential, enter:\n\n- The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting\n- The **Password** that goes with that username\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports digest authentication.\n\nTo configure this credential, enter:\n\n- The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting\n- The **Password** that goes with that username\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports header authentication.\n\nTo configure this credential, enter:\n\n- The header **Name** you need to pass to the app or service your HTTP request is targeting\n- The **Value** for the header\n\nRead more about [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers#authentication)\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports bearer authentication. This authentication type is actually just header authentication with the `Name` set to `Authorization` and the `Value` set to `Bearer <token>`.\n\nTo configure this credential, enter:\n\n- The **Bearer Token** you need to pass to the app or service your HTTP request is targeting\n\nRead more about [bearer authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/authentication/bearer-authentication/).\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth1 authentication.\n\nTo configure this credential, enter:\n\n- An **Authorization URL**: Also known as the Resource Owner Authorization URI. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/authorize`. The temporary credentials are sent here to prompt a user to complete authorization.\n- An **Access Token URL**: This is the URI used for the initial request for temporary credentials. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/request` or `/oauth1/token`.\n- A **Consumer Key**: Also known as the client key, like a username. This specifies the `oauth_consumer_key` to use for the call.\n- A **Consumer Secret**: Also known as the client secret, like a password.\n- A **Request Token URL**: This is the URI used to switch from temporary credentials to long-lived credentials after authorization. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/access`.\n- Select the **Signature Method** the auth handshake uses. This specifies the `oauth_signature_method` to use for the call. Options include:\n  - **HMAC-SHA1**\n  - **HMAC-SHA256**\n  - **HMAC-SHA512**\n\nFor most OAuth1 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration to generate the values for most of these fields. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.\n\nRead more about [OAuth1](https://oauth.net/1/) and the [OAuth1 authorization flow](https://oauth1.wp-api.org/docs/basics/Auth-Flow.html).\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth2 authentication.\n\nRequirements to configure this credential depend on the **Grant Type** selected. Refer to [OAuth Grant Types](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/) for more information on each grant type.\n\nFor most OAuth2 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.\n\nRead more about [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/).\n\n### Authorization Code grant type\n\nUse Authorization Code grant type to exchange an authorization code for an access token. The auth flow uses the redirect URL to return the user to the client. Then the application gets the authorization code from the URL and uses it to request an access token. Refer to [Authorization Code Request](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/) for more information.\n\nTo configure this credential, select **Authorization Code** as the **Grant Type**.\n\n- An **Authorization URL**\n- An **Access Token URL**\n- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to log in with.\n- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in with.\n- *Optional:* Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.\n- *Optional:* Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.\n- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:\n  - **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.\n  - **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.\n- *Optional:* Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.\n\n### Client Credentials grant type\n\nUse the Client Credentials grant type when applications request an access token to access their own resources, not on behalf of a user. Refer to [Client Credentials](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/) for more information.\n\nTo configure this credential, select **Client Credentials** as the **Grant Type**.\n\n- An **Access Token URL**: The URL to hit to begin the OAuth2 flow. Typically this URL ends in `/token`.\n- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to use to log in to the client.\n- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in to the client.\n- *Optional:* Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. Most services don't support scopes for Client Credentials grant types; only enter scopes here if yours does.\n- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:\n  - **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.\n  - **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.\n- *Optional:* Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.\n\nProof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) grant type is an extension to the Authorization Code flow to prevent CSRF and authorization code injection attacks.\n\nTo configure this credential, select **PKCE** as the **Grant Type**.\n\n- An **Authorization URL**\n- An **Access Token URL**\n- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to log in with.\n- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in with.\n- *Optional:* Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.\n- *Optional:* Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.\n- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:\n  - **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.\n  - **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.\n- *Optional:* Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as a single key/value query parameter. (For multiple query parameters, use [Custom Auth](#using-custom-auth).)\n\nTo configure this credential, enter:\n\n- A query parameter key or **Name**\n- A query parameter **Value**\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as multiple key/value query parameters or you need more flexibility than the other generic auth options.\n\nThe **Custom Auth** credential expects JSON data to define your credential. You can use `headers`, `qs`, `body` or a mix. Review the examples below to get started.\n\n### Sending two headers\n\n### Sending header and query string\n\n## Provide an SSL certificate\n\nYou can send an SSL certificate with your HTTP request. Create the SSL certificate as a separate credential for use by the node:\n\n1. In the HTTP Request node **Settings**, turn on **SSL Certificates**.\n1. On the **Parameters** tab, add an existing SSL Certificate credential to **Credential for SSL Certificates** or create a new one.\n\nTo configure your SSL Certificates credential, you'll need to add:\n\n- The Certificate Authority **CA** bundle\n- The **Certificate** (CRT): May also appear as a Public Key, depending on who your issuing CA was and how they format the cert\n- The **Private Key** (KEY)\n- *Optional:* If the **Private Key** is encrypted, enter a **Passphrase** for the private key.\n\nIf your SSL certificate is in a single file (such as a `.pfx` file), you'll need to open the file to copy details from it to paste into the appropriate fields:\n\n- Enter the Public Key/CRT as the **Certificate**\n- Enter the **Private Key**/KEY in that field",
