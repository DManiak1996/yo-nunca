  "content": "Use the Airtable node to automate work in Airtable, and integrate Airtable with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Airtable features, including creating, reading, listing, updating and deleting tables.\n\nOn this page, you'll find a list of operations the Airtable node supports and links to more resources.\n\nRefer to [Airtable credentials](../../credentials/airtable/) for guidance on setting up authentication.\n\n- Append the data to a table\n- Delete data from a table\n- List data from a table\n- Read data from a table\n- Update data in a table\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Handling Appointment Leads and Follow-up With Twilio, Cal.com and AI**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2342-handling-appointment-leads-and-follow-up-with-twilio-calcom-and-ai/)\n\n**AI-Powered Social Media Amplifier**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2681-ai-powered-social-media-amplifier/)\n\n**Technical stock analysis with Telegram, Airtable and a GPT-powered AI Agent**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/3053-technical-stock-analysis-with-telegram-airtable-and-a-gpt-powered-ai-agent/)\n\n[Browse Airtable integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/airtable/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nn8n provides a trigger node for Airtable. You can find the trigger node docs [here](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtabletrigger/).\n\nRefer to [Airtable's documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction) for more information about the service.\n\n## What to do if your operation isn't supported\n\nIf this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.\n\nYou can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:\n\n1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.\n1. Select the service you want to connect to.\n1. Select your credential.\n\nRefer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.\n\n### Get the Record ID\n\nTo fetch data for a particular record, you need the Record ID. There are two ways to get the Record ID.\n\n### Create a Record ID column in Airtable\n\nTo create a `Record ID` column in your table, refer to this [article](https://support.airtable.com/docs/finding-airtable-ids). You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.\n\n### Use the List operation\n\nTo get the Record ID of your record, you can use the **List** operation of the Airtable node. This operation will return the Record ID along with the fields. You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.\n\n### Filter records when using the List operation\n\nTo filter records from your Airtable base, use the **Filter By Formula** option. For example, if you want to return all the users that belong to the organization `n8n`, follow the steps mentioned below:\n\n1. Select 'List' from the **Operation** dropdown list.\n1. Enter the base ID and the table name in the **Base ID** and **Table** field, respectively.\n1. Click on **Add Option** and select 'Filter By Formula' from the dropdown list.\n1. Enter the following formula in the **Filter By Formula** field: `{Organization}='n8n'`.\n\nSimilarly, if you want to return all the users that don't belong to the organization `n8n`, use the following formula: `NOT({Organization}='n8n')`.\n\nRefer to the Airtable [documentation](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/203255215-Formula-Field-Reference) to learn more about the formulas.\n\nFor common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common Issues](common-issues/).",
