Open your [**API Personal Preferences**](https://app.pipedrive.com/settings/api).\n1. Copy **Your personal API token** and enter it in your n8n credential.\n\nIf you have multiple companies, you'll need to select the correct company first:\n\n1. Select your account name and be sure you're viewing the correct company.\n1. Then select **Company Settings**.\n1. Select **Personal Preferences**.\n1. Select the **API** tab.\n1.

Select your profile name in the upper right corner.\n\n1. Find the company name of your sandbox account and select **Developer Hub**.\n\nIf you don't see **Developer Hub** in your account dropdown, sign up for a [developer sandbox account](https://developers.pipedrive.com/).\n\n1.

Turn on appropriate **Scopes** for your app. Refer to [Pipedrive node scopes](#pipedrive-node-scopes) and [Pipedrive Trigger node scopes](#pipedrive-trigger-node-scopes) below for more guidance.\n\n1. Copy the **Client ID** and enter it in your n8n credential.\n\n1. Copy the **Client Secret** and enter it in your n8n credential.\n\nRefer to [Registering a public app](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-registering-the-app) for more information.\n\n### Pipedrive node scopes\n\nThe scopes you add to your app depend on which node(s) you want to use it for in n8n and what actions you want to complete with those.\n\nScopes you may need for the [Pipedrive](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pipedrive/) node:\n\n| **Object**    | **Node action**                                                  | **UI scope**                                             | **Actual scope**                       |\n| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| Activity      | Get data of an activity Get data of all activities               | **Activities: Read only** or **Activities: Full Access** | `activities:read` or `activities:full` |\n| Activity      | Create Delete Update                                             | **Activities: Full Access**                              | `activities:full`                      |\n| Deal          | Get data of a deal Get data of all deals Search a deal           | **Deals: Read only** or **Deals: Full Access**           | `deals:read` or `deals:full`           |\n| Deal          | Create Delete Duplicate Update                                   | **Deals: Full Access**                                   | `deals:full`                           |\n| Deal Activity | Get all activities of a deal                                     | **Activities: Read only** or **Activities: Full Access** | `activities:read` or `activities:full` |\n| Deal Product  | Get all products in a deal                                       | **Products: Read Only** or **Products: Full Access**     | `products:read` or `products:full`     |\n| File          | Download Get data of a file                                      | Refer to note below                                      | Refer to note below                    |\n| File          | Create Delete                                                    | Refer to note below                                      | Refer to note below                    |\n| Lead          | Get data of a lead Get data of all leads                         | **Leads: Read only** or **Leads: Full access**           | `leads:read` or `leads:full`           |\n| Lead          | Create Delete Update                                             | **Leads: Full access**                                   | `leads:full`                           |\n| Note          | Get data of a note Get data of all notes                         | Refer to note below                                      | Refer to note below                    |\n| Note          | Create Delete Update                                             | Refer to note below                                      | Refer to note below                    |\n| Organization  | Get data of an organization Get data of all organizations Search | **Contacts: Read Only** or **Contacts: Full Access**     | `contacts:read` or `contacts:full`     |\n| Organization  | Create Delete Update                                             | **Contacts: Full Access**                                | `contacts:full`                        |\n| Person        | Get data of a person Get data of all persons Search              | **Contacts: Read Only** or **Contacts: Full Access**     | `contacts:read` or `contacts:full`     |\n| Person        | Create Delete Update                                             | **Contacts: Full Access**                                | `contacts:full`                        |\n| Product       | Get data of all products                                         | **Products: Read Only**                                  | `products:read`                        |\n\nThe scopes for Files and Notes depend on which object they relate to:\n\n- Files relate to Deals, Activities, or Contacts.\n- Notes relate to Deals or Contacts.\n\nRefer to those objects' scopes.\n\nThe Pipedrive node also supports Custom API calls.
