Use this node (TheHive 5) if you want to use TheHive's version 5 API. If you want to use version 3 or 4, use [TheHive](../n8n-nodes-base.thehive/).\n\nRefer to [TheHive credentials](../../credentials/thehive5/) for guidance on setting up authentication.\n\n- Alert\n  - Create\n  - Delete\n  - Execute Responder\n  - Get\n  - Merge Into Case\n  - Promote to Case\n  - Search\n  - Update\n  - Update Status\n- Case\n  - Add Attachment\n  - Create\n  - Delete Attachment\n  - Delete Case\n  - Execute Responder\n  - Get\n  - Get Attachment\n  - Get Timeline\n  - Search\n  - Update\n- Comment\n  - Create\n  - Delete\n  - Search\n  - Update\n- Observable\n  - Create\n  - Delete\n  - Execute Analyzer\n  - Execute Responder\n  - Get\n  - Search\n  - Update\n- Page\n  - Create\n  - Delete\n  - Search\n  - Update\n- Query\n  - Execute Query\n- Task\n  - Create\n  - Delete\n  - Execute Responder\n  - Get\n  - Search\n  - Update\n- Task Log\n  - Add Attachment\n  - Create\n  - Delete\n  - Delete Attachment\n  - Execute Responder\n  - Get\n  - Search\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n[Browse TheHive 5 integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/thehive-5/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nn8n provides a trigger node for TheHive.
