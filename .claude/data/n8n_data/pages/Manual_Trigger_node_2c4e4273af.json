Most workflows start with a trigger node firing in response to an external event or the [Schedule Trigger](../n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/) firing on a set schedule.\n\nThe Manual Trigger node serves as the workflow trigger for workflows that don't have an automatic trigger.\n\n- To test your workflow before you add an automatic trigger of some kind.\n- When you don't want the workflow to run automatically.\n\nHere are some common errors and issues with the Manual Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.\n\n### Only one 'Manual Trigger' node is allowed in a workflow\n\nThis error displays if you try to add a Manual Trigger node to a workflow which already includes a Manual Trigger node.\n\nRemove your existing Manual Trigger or edit your workflow to connect that trigger to a different node.",
