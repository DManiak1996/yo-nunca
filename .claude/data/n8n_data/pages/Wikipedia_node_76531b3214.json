  "content": "The Wikipedia node is a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) that allows an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to search and return information from Wikipedia.\n\nParameter resolution in sub-nodes\n\nSub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.\n\nMost nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Respond to WhatsApp Messages with AI Like a Pro!**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2466-respond-to-whatsapp-messages-with-ai-like-a-pro/)\n\n**AI chatbot that can search the web**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1959-ai-chatbot-that-can-search-the-web/)\n\n**Write a WordPress post with AI (starting from a few keywords)**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2187-write-a-wordpress-post-with-ai-starting-from-a-few-keywords/)\n\n[Browse Wikipedia integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/wikipedia/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [LangChain's documentation on tools](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/tool-calling/) for more information about tools in LangChain.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
