Their documentation is behind a log in, so you must log in to your account on their website to access the API documentation.\n\nThis is a credential-only node. Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) to learn more. View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/crowdstrike/) on n8n's website.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- The **URL** of your CrowdStrike instance\n- A **Client ID**: Generated by creating a new API Client in Crowdstrike in **Support > API Clients and Keys**.\n- A **Client Secret**: Generated by creating a new API Client in Crowdstrike in **Support > API Clients and Keys**.\n\nWhen setting up your API client, grant it the `usermgmt:read` scope. n8n relies on this to test that the credential is working.\n\nA broad outline of the appropriate steps is available publicly at the CrowdStrike blog: [Getting Access to the CrowdStrike API](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/tech-center/get-access-falcon-apis/).
