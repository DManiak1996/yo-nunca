This can be an interval or a specific wall time.\n- **Append n8n Attribution**: Set whether to include the phrase `This email was sent automatically with n8n` at the end of the email (turned on) or not (turned off).\n\n### Free Text parameters and options\n\nWhen using the Free Text response type, the following options are available:\n\n- **Message Button Label**: The label to use for message button.
