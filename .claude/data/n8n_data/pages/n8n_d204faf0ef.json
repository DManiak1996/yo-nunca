  "content": "A node to integrate with n8n itself. This node allows you to consume the [n8n API](../../../../api/) in your workflows.\n\nRefer to the [n8n REST API documentation](../../../../api/) for more information on using the n8n API. Refer to [API endpoint reference](../../../../api/api-reference/) for working with the API endpoints directly.\n\nYou can find authentication information for this node in the [API authentication](../../../../api/authentication/) documentation.\n\nThis node doesn't support SSL. If your server requires an SSL connection, use the [HTTP Request node](../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the [n8n API](../../../../api/). The HTTP Request node has options to [provide the SSL certificate](../../credentials/httprequest/#provide-an-ssl-certificate).\n\n- Audit\n  - [**Generate** a security audit](#generate-audit)\n- Credential\n  - [**Create** a credential](#create-credential)\n  - [**Delete** a credential](#delete-credential)\n  - [**Get Schema**](#get-credential-schema): Use this operation to get credential data schema for type\n- Execution\n  - [**Get** an execution](#get-execution)\n  - [**Get Many** executions](#get-many-executions)\n  - [**Delete** an execution](#delete-execution)\n- Workflow\n  - [**Activate** a workflow](#activate-deactivate-delete-and-get-workflow)\n  - [**Create** a workflow](#create-workflow)\n  - [**Deactivate** a workflow](#activate-deactivate-delete-and-get-workflow)\n  - [**Delete** a workflow](#activate-deactivate-delete-and-get-workflow)\n  - [**Get** a workflow](#activate-deactivate-delete-and-get-workflow)\n  - [**Get Many** workflows](#get-many-workflows)\n  - [**Update** a workflow](#update-workflow)\n\nThis operation has no parameters. Configure it with these options:\n\n- **Categories**: Select the risk categories you want the audit to include. Options include:\n  - **Credentials**\n  - **Database**\n  - **Filesystem**\n  - **Instance**\n  - **Nodes**\n- **Days Abandoned Workflow**: Use this option to set the number of days without execution after which a workflow should be considered abandoned. Enter a number of days. The default is `90`.\n\nConfigure this operation with these parameters:\n\n- **Name**: Enter the name of the credential you'd like to create.\n- **Credential Type**: Enter the credential's type. The available types depend on nodes installed on the n8n instance. Some built-in types include `githubApi`, `notionApi`, and `slackApi`.\n- **Data**: Enter a valid JSON object with the required properties for this **Credential Type**. To see the expected format, use the **Get Schema** operation.\n\nConfigure this operation with this parameter:\n\n- **Credential ID**: Enter the ID of the credential you want to delete.\n\n## Get credential schema\n\nConfigure this operation with this parameter:\n\n- **Credential Type**: Enter the credential's type. The available types depend on nodes installed on the n8n instance. Some built-in types include `githubApi`, `notionApi`, and `slackApi`.\n\nConfigure this operation with this parameter:\n\n- **Execution ID**: Enter the ID of the execution you want to retrieve.\n\n### Get execution option\n\nYou can further configure this operation with this **Option**:\n\n- **Include Execution Details**: Use this control to set whether to include the detailed execution data (turned on) or not (turned off).\n\n## Get many executions\n\nConfigure this operation with these parameters:\n\n- **Return All**: Set whether to return all results (turned on) or whether to limit the results to the entered **Limit** (turned on).\n- **Limit**: Set the number of results to return if the **Return All** control is turned off.\n\n### Get many executions filters\n\nYou can further configure this operation with these **Filters**:\n\n- **Workflow**: Filter the executions by workflow. Options include:\n  - **From list**: Select a workflow to use as a filter.\n  - **By URL**: Enter a workflow URL to use as a filter.\n  - **By ID**: Enter a workflow ID to use as a filter.\n- **Status**: Filter the executions by status. Options include:\n  - **Error**\n  - **Success**\n  - **Waiting**\n\n### Get many execution options\n\nYou can further configure this operation with this **Option**:\n\n- **Include Execution Details**: Use this control to set whether to include the detailed execution data (turned on) or not (turned off).\n\nConfigure this operation with this parameter:\n\n- **Execution ID**: Enter the ID of the execution you want to delete.\n\n## Activate, deactivate, delete, and get workflow\n\nThe **Activate**, **Deactivate**, **Delete**, and **Get** workflow operations all include the same parameter for you to select the **Workflow** you want to perform the operation on. Options include:\n\n- **From list**: Select the workflow from the list.\n- **By URL**: Enter the URL of the workflow.\n- **By ID**: Enter the ID of the workflow.\n\nConfigure this operation with this parameter:\n\n- **Workflow Object**: Enter a valid JSON object with the new workflow's details. The object requires these fields:\n  - `name`\n  - `nodes`\n  - `connections`\n  - `settings`\n\nRefer to [n8n API reference](../../../../api/api-reference/) for more information.\n\n## Get many workflows\n\nConfigure this operation with these parameters:\n\n- **Return All**: Set whether to return all results (turned on) or whether to limit the results to the entered **Limit** (turned on).\n- **Limit**: Set the number of results to return if the **Return All** control is turned off.\n\n### Get many workflows filters\n\nYou can further configure this operation with these **Filters**:\n\n- **Return Only Active Workflows**: Select whether to return only active workflows (turned on) or active and inactive workflows (turned off).\n- **Tags**: Enter a comma-separated list of tags the returned workflows must have.\n\nConfigure this operation with these parameters:\n\n- **Workflow**: Select the workflow you want to update. Options include:\n  - **From list**: Select the workflow from the list.\n  - **By URL**: Enter the URL of the workflow.\n  - **By ID**: Enter the ID of the workflow.\n- **Workflow Object**: Enter a valid JSON object to update the workflow with.
