  "content": "Here are some common issues and questions for the [Webhook node](../) and suggested solutions.\n\n## Listen for multiple HTTP methods\n\nBy default, the Webhook node accepts calls that use a single method. For example, it can accept GET or POST requests, but not both. If you want to accept calls using multiple methods:\n\n1. Open the node **Settings**.\n1. Turn on **Allow Multiple HTTP Methods**.\n1. Return to **Parameters**. By default, the node now accepts GET and POST calls. You can add other methods in the **HTTP Methods** field.\n\nThe Webhook node has an output for each method, so you can perform different actions depending on the method.\n\n## Use the HTTP Request node to trigger the Webhook node\n\nThe [HTTP Request](../../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node makes HTTP requests to the URL you specify.\n\n1. Create a new workflow.\n1. Add the HTTP Request node to the workflow.\n1. Select a method from the **Request Method** dropdown list. For example, if you select GET as the **HTTP method** in your Webhook node, select GET as the request method in the HTTP Request node.\n1. Copy the URL from the Webhook node, and paste it in the **URL** field in the HTTP Request node.\n1. If using the test URL for the webhook node: execute the workflow with the Webhook node.\n1. Execute the HTTP Request node.\n\n## Use curl to trigger the Webhook node\n\nYou can use [curl](https://curl.se/) to make HTTP requests that trigger the Webhook node.\n\nIn the examples, replace `<https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>` with your webhook URL.\\\nThe examples make GET requests. You can use whichever HTTP method you set in **HTTP Method**.\n\nMake an HTTP request without any parameters:\n\nMake an HTTP request with a body parameter:\n\nMake an HTTP request with header parameter:\n\nMake an HTTP request to send a file:\n\nReplace `/path/to/file` with the path of the file you want to send.\n\n## Send a response of type string\n\nBy default, the response format is JSON or an array. To send a response of type string:\n\n1. Select **Response Mode** > **When Last Node Finishes**.\n1. Select **Response Data** > **First Entry JSON**.\n1. Select **Add Option** > **Property Name**.\n1. Enter the name of the property that contains the response. This defaults to `data`.\n1. Connect an [Edit Fields node](../../n8n-nodes-base.set/) to the Webhook node.\n1. In the Edit Fields node, select **Add Value** > **String**.\n1. Enter the name of the property in the **Name** field. The name should match the property name from step 4.\n1. Enter the string value in the **Value** field.\n1. Toggle **Keep Only Set** to on (green).\n\nWhen you call the Webhook, it sends the string response from the Edit Fields node.\n\n## Test URL versus Production URL\n\nn8n generates two **Webhook URLs** for each Webhook node: a **Test URL** and a **Production URL**.\n\nWhile building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL**. Once you're ready to use your Webhook URL in production, use the **Production URL**.\n\n| **URL type**   | **How to trigger**                                                         | **Listening duration**     | **Data shown in editor UI?** |\n| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| Test URL       | Select **Listen for test event** and trigger a test event from the source. | 120 seconds                |                              |\n| Production URL | Activate the workflow                                                      | Until workflow deactivated |                              |\n\nRefer to [Workflow development](../workflow-development/) for more information.\n\n## IP addresses in whitelist are failing to connect\n\nIf you're unable to connect from IP addresses in your IP whitelist, check if you are running n8n behind a reverse proxy.\n\nIf so, set the `N8N_PROXY_HOPS` [environment variable](../../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) to the number of reverse-proxies n8n is running behind.\n\n## Only one webhook per path and method\n\nn8n only permits registering one webhook for each path and HTTP method combination (for example, a `GET` request for `/my-request`). This avoids ambiguity over which webhook should receive requests.\n\nIf you receive a message that the path and method you chose are already in use, you can either:\n\n- Deactivate the workflow with the conflicting webhook.\n- Change the webhook path and/or method for one of the conflicting webhooks.\n\n## Timeouts on n8n Cloud\n\nn8n Cloud uses Cloudflare to protect against malicious traffic. If your webhook doesn't respond within 100 seconds, the incoming request will fail with a [524 status code](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/cloudflare-5xx-errors/error-524/).\n\nBecause of this, for long-running processes that might exceed this limit, you may need to introduce polling logic by configuring two separate webhooks:\n\n- One webhook to start the long-running process and send an immediate response.\n- A second webhook that you can call at intervals to query the status of the process and retrieve the result once it's complete.",
