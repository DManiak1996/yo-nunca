  "content": "Splitting uses the [IF](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or [Switch](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) nodes. It turns a single-branch workflow into a multi-branch workflow. This is a key piece of representing complex logic in n8n.\n\nCompare these workflows:\n\nThis is the power of splitting and conditional nodes in n8n.\n\nRefer to the [IF](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or [Switch](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) documentation for usage details.",
