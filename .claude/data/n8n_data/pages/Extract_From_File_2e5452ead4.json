  "title": "Extract From File",
  "content": "A common pattern in n8n workflows is to receive a file, either from an [HTTP Request node](../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) (for files you are fetching from a website), a [Webhook Node](../n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) (for files which are sent to your workflow from elsewhere), or from a local source. Data obtained in this way is often in a binary format, for example a spreadsheet or PDF.\n\nThe Extract From File node extracts data from a binary format file and converts it to JSON, which can then be easily manipulated by the rest of your workflow. For converting JSON back into a binary file type, please see the [Convert to File](../n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) node.\n\nUse the **Operations** drop-down to select the format of the source file to extract data from.\n\n- **Extract From CSV**: The \"Comma Separated Values\" file type is commonly used for tabulated data.\n- **Extract From HTML**: Extract fields from standard web page HTML format files.\n- **Extract From JSON**: Extract JSON data from a binary file.\n- **Extract From ICS**: Extract fields from iCalendar format files.\n- **Extract From ODS**: Extract fields from ODS spreadsheet files.\n- **Extract From PDF**: Extract fields from Portable Document Format files.\n- **Extract From RTF**: Extract fields from Rich Text Format files.\n- **Extract From Text File**: Extract fields from a standard text file format.\n- **Extract From XLS**: Extract fields from a Microsoft Excel file (older format).\n- **Extract From XLSX**: Extract fields from a Microsoft Excel file.\n- **Move File to Base64 String**: Converts binary data to a text-friendly [base64](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-4) format.\n\nIn this example, a Webhook node is used to trigger the workflow. When a CSV file is sent to the webhook address, the file data is output and received by the Extract From File node.\n\n[View workflow file](/_workflows/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/webhook-example.json)\n\nSet to operate as 'Extract from CSV', the node then outputs the data as a series of JSON 'row' objects:\n\nReceiving files with a webhook\n\nSelect the Webhook Node's **Add Options** button and select **Raw body**, then enable that setting to get the node to output the binary file that the subsequent node is expecting.\n\n### Input Binary Field\n\nEnter the name of the field from the node input data that contains the binary file. The default is 'data'.\n\n### Destination Output Field\n\nEnter the name of the field in the node output that will contain the extracted data.\n\nThis parameter is only available for these operations:\n\n- Extract From JSON\n- Extract From ICS\n- Extract From Text File\n- Move File to Base64 String\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Building Your First WhatsApp Chatbot**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/)\n\n**Extract text from a PDF file**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/585-extract-text-from-a-pdf-file/)\n\n**Scrape and store data from multiple website pages**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1073-scrape-and-store-data-from-multiple-website-pages/)\n\n[Browse Extract From File integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/extract-from-file/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)",
