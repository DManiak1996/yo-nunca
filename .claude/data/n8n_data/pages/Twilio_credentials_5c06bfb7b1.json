In n8n, select **Auth Token** as the **Auth Type**.\n1. In Twilio, go to **Console Dashboard > Account Info**.\n1. Copy your **Account SID** and enter this in your n8n credential.

In n8n, select **API Key** as the **Auth Type**.\n1. In Twilio, go to **Console Dashboard > Account Info**.\n1. Copy your **Account SID** and enter it in your n8n credential.\n1.

On the **Copy secret key** page, copy the **SID** displayed with the key and enter it in your n8n credential **API Key SID**.\n1. On the **Copy secret key** page, copy the **Secret** displayed with the key and enter it in your n8n credential **API Key Secret**.\n\nRefer to [Create an API key](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/api-keys#create-an-api-key) for more detailed instructions.\n\n### Selecting an API key type\n\nWhen you create a Twilio API key, you must select a key type. The n8n credential works with **Main** and **Standard** key types.\n\nHere are more details on the different API key types:\n\n- **Main**: This key type gives you the same level of access as using your Account SID and Auth Token in API requests.\n- **Standard**: This key type gives you access to all the functionality in Twilio's APIs except the API key resources and Account resources.\n- **Restricted**: This key type is in beta. n8n hasn't tested the credential against this key type; if you try it, let us know if you run into any issues.\n\nRefer to [Types of API keys](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/api-keys#types-of-api-keys) for more information on the key types.",
