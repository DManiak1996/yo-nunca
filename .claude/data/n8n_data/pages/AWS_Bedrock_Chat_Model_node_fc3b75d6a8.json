  "content": "The AWS Bedrock Chat Model node allows you use LLM models utilising AWS Bedrock platform.\n\nOn this page, you'll find the node parameters for the AWS Bedrock Chat Model node, and links to more resources.\n\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/aws/).\n\nParameter resolution in sub-nodes\n\nSub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.\n\nMost nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n- **Model**: Select the model that generates the completion.\n\nLearn more about available models in the [Amazon Bedrock model documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.html).\n\n- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.\n- **Sampling Temperature**: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.\n\nThis node doesn't support the [`NO_PROXY` environment variable](../../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/).\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n[Browse AWS Bedrock Chat Model integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/aws-bedrock-chat-model/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [LangChains's AWS Bedrock Chat Model documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/bedrock/) for more information about the service.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
