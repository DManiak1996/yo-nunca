  "content": "Use the OpenAI Chat Model node to use OpenAI's chat models with conversational [agents](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent).\n\nOn this page, you'll find the node parameters for the OpenAI Chat Model node and links to more resources.\n\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/openai/).\n\nParameter resolution in sub-nodes\n\nSub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.\n\nMost nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\nSelect the model to use to generate the completion.\n\nn8n dynamically loads models from OpenAI, and you'll only see the models available to your account.\n\nThe OpenAI Responses API provides a range of [built-in tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools) to enrich the model's response:\n\n- **Web Search**: Allows models to search the web for the latest information before generating a response.\n- **MCP Servers**: Allows models to connect to remote MCP servers. Find out more about using remote MCP servers as tools [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp).\n- **File Search**: Allow models to search your knowledgebase from previously uploaded files for relevant information before generating a response. Refer to the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search) for more information.\n- **Code Interpreter**: Allows models to write and run Python code in a sandboxed environment.\n\nUse these options to further refine the node's behavior.\n\nEnter a URL here to override the default URL for the API.\n\n### Frequency Penalty\n\nUse this option to control the chances of the model repeating itself. Higher values reduce the chance of the model repeating itself.\n\n### Maximum Number of Tokens\n\nEnter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.\n\nChoose **Text** or **JSON**. **JSON** ensures the model returns valid JSON.\n\nUse this option to control the chances of the model talking about new topics. Higher values increase the chance of the model talking about new topics.\n\n### Sampling Temperature\n\nUse this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.\n\nEnter the maximum request time in milliseconds.\n\nEnter the maximum number of times to retry a request.\n\nUse this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.\n\nThe conversation that this response belongs to. Input items and output items from this response are automatically added to this conversation after this response completes.\n\nUse this key for caching similar requests to optimize cache hit rates.\n\n### Safety Identifier\n\nApply an identifier to track users who may violate usage policies.\n\nSelect the service tier that fits your needs: Auto, Flex, Default, or Priority.\n\nA set of key-value pairs for storing structured information. You can attach up to 16 pairs to an object, which is useful for adding custom data that can be used for searching by the API or in the dashboard.\n\nDefine an integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.\n\nChoose a response format: Text, JSON Schema, or JSON Object. Use of JSON Schema is recommended, if you want to receive data in JSON format.\n\nConfigure the prompt filled with a unique ID, its version, and substitutable variables.\n\nControl the reasoning level of AI results: Low, Medium, or High.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1954-ai-agent-chat/)\n\n**Building Your First WhatsApp Chatbot**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/)\n\n**Scrape and summarize webpages with AI**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1951-scrape-and-summarize-webpages-with-ai/)\n\n[Browse OpenAI Chat Model integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/openai-chat-model/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [LangChains's OpenAI documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/openai/) for more information about the service.\n\nRefer to [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses/create) for more information about the parameters.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.\n\nFor common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](common-issues/).",
