In Mattermost, go to **Profile > Security > Personal Access Tokens**.\n\nNo Personal Access Tokens option\n\nIf you don't see the Personal Access Tokens option, refer to the troubleshooting steps in [Enable personal access tokens](#enable-personal-access-tokens) below.\n\n1. Select **Create Token**.\n\n1. Enter a **Token description**, like `n8n integration`.\n\n1. Copy the **Token ID** and enter it as the **Access Token** in your n8n credential.\n\n1. Enter your Mattermost URL as the **Base URL**.\n\n1. By default, n8n connects only if SSL certificate validation succeeds. To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.\n\nRefer to the Mattermost [Personal access tokens documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/reference/personal-access-token/) for more information.\n\n## Enable personal access tokens\n\nNot seeing the **Personal Access Tokens** option has two possible causes:\n\n- Mattermost doesn't have the personal access tokens integration enabled.\n- You're trying to generate a personal access token as a non-admin user who doesn't have permission to generate personal access tokens.\n\nTo identify the root cause and resolve it:\n\n1. Log in to Mattermost as an admin.\n1. Go to **System Console > Integrations > Integration Management**.\n1. Confirm that **Enable personal access tokens** is set to **true**. If it's not, change.\n1. Go to **System Console > User Management > Users**.\n1. Search for the user account you want to allow to generate personal access tokens.\n1. Select the **Actions** dropdown for the user and select **Manage roles**.\n1. Check the box for **Allow this account to generate personal access tokens** and **Save**.\n\nRefer to the Mattermost [Personal access tokens documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/reference/personal-access-token/) for more information.",
