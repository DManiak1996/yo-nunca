WhatsApp will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.\n\nTo work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:\n\nHalts production traffic\n\nThis workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.\n\n1. Go to your workflow page.\n1. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.\n1. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.\n1. When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.",
