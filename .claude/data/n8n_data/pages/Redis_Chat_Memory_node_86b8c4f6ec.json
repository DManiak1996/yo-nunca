You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n- **Session Key**: Enter the key to use to store the memory in the workflow data.\n- **Session Time To Live**: Use this parameter to make the session expire after a given number of seconds.\n- **Context Window Length**: Enter the number of previous interactions to consider for context.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Build your own N8N Workflows MCP Server**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/3770-build-your-own-n8n-workflows-mcp-server/)\n\n**Conversational Interviews with AI Agents and n8n Forms**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2566-conversational-interviews-with-ai-agents-and-n8n-forms/)\n\n**Telegram AI Bot-to-Human Handoff for Sales Calls**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/3350-telegram-ai-bot-to-human-handoff-for-sales-calls/)\n\n[Browse Redis Chat Memory integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/redis-chat-memory/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [LangChain's Redis Chat Memory documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/memory/redis) for more information about the service.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.\n\n## Single memory instance\n\nIf you add more than one Redis Chat Memory node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](../n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.",
