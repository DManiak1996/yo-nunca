  "content": "n8n can handle up to 220 workflow executions per second on a single instance, with the ability to scale up further by adding more instances.\n\nThis document outlines n8n's performance benchmarking. It describes the factors that affect performance, and includes two example benchmarks.\n\n## Performance factors\n\nThe performance of n8n depends on factors including:\n\n- The workflow type\n- The resources available to n8n\n- How you configure n8n's scaling options\n\n## Run your own benchmarking\n\nTo get an accurate estimate for your use case, run n8n's [benchmarking framework](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/%40n8n/benchmark). The repository contains more information about the benchmarking.\n\n## Example: Single instance performance\n\nThis test measures how response time increases as requests per second increase. It looks at the response time when calling the Webhook Trigger node.\n\n- Hardware: ECS c5a.large instance (4GB RAM)\n- n8n setup: Single n8n instance (running in main mode, with Postgres database)\n- Workflow: Webhook Trigger node, Edit Fields node\n\nThis graph shows the percentage of requests to the Webhook Trigger node getting a response within 100 seconds, and how that varies with load. Under higher loads n8n usually still processes the data, but takes over 100s to respond.\n\n## Example: Multi-instance performance\n\nThis test measures how response time increases as requests per second increase. It looks at the response time when calling the Webhook Trigger node.\n\n- Hardware: seven ECS c5a.4xlarge instances (8GB RAM each)\n- n8n setup: two webhook instances, four worker instances, one database instance (MySQL), one main instance running n8n and Redis\n- Workflow: Webhook Trigger node, Edit Fields node\n- Multi-instance setups use [Queue mode](../queue-mode/)\n\nThis graph shows the percentage of requests to the Webhook Trigger node getting a response within 100 seconds, and how that varies with load. Under higher loads n8n usually still processes the data, but takes over 100s to respond.",
