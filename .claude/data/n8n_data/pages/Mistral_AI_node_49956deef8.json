  "content": "Use the Mistral AI node to automate work in Mistral AI and integrate Mistral AI with other applications. n8n has built-in support for extracting text with various models, file types, and input methods.\n\nOn this page, you'll find a list of operations the Mistral AI node supports, and links to more resources.\n\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/mistral/).\n\n- **Resource**: The resource that Mistral AI should operate on. The current implementation supports the \"Document\" resource.\n- **Operation**: The operation to perform:\n  - **Extract Text**: Extracts text from a document or image using optical character recognition (OCR).\n- **Model**: The model to use for the given operation. The current version requires the `mistral-ocr-latest` model.\n- **Document Type**: The document format to process. Can be \"Document\" or \"Image\".\n- **Input Type**: How to input the document:\n  - **Binary Data**: Pass the document to this node as a binary field.\n  - **URL**: Fetch the document from a given URL.\n- **Input Binary Field**: When using the \"Binary Data\" input type, defines the name of the input binary field containing the file.\n- **URL**: When using the \"URL\" input type, the URL of the document or image to process.\n\n- **Enable Batch Processing**: Whether to process multiple documents in the same API call. This may reduce your costs by bundling requests.\n- **Batch Size**: When using \"Enable Batch Processing\", sets the maximum number of documents to process per batch.\n- **Delete Files After Processing**: When using \"Enable Batch Processing\", whether to delete the files from Mistral Cloud after processing.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**🤖 AI content generation for Auto Service 🚘 Automate your social media📲!**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/4600-ai-content-generation-for-auto-service-automate-your-social-media/)\n\n**Build a PDF Document RAG System with Mistral OCR, Qdrant and Gemini AI**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/4400-build-a-pdf-document-rag-system-with-mistral-ocr-qdrant-and-gemini-ai/)\n\n**Organise Your Local File Directories With AI**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2334-organise-your-local-file-directories-with-ai/)\n\n[Browse Mistral AI integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/mistral-ai/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [Mistral AI's documentation](https://docs.mistral.ai/api/) for more information about the service.\n\n## What to do if your operation isn't supported\n\nIf this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.\n\nYou can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:\n\n1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.\n1. Select the service you want to connect to.\n1. Select your credential.\n\nRefer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.",
