  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [TimescaleDB](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.timescaledb/)\n\nAn available instance of [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/).\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\n- Database connection\n\nRefer to the [Timescale documentation](https://docs.timescale.com/) for more information about the service.\n\n## Using database connection\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- The **Host**: The fully qualified server name or IP address of your TimescaleDB server.\n- The **Database**: The name of the database to connect to.\n- A **User**: The user name you want to log in with.\n- A **Password**: Enter the password for the database user you are connecting to.\n- **Ignore SSL Issues**: If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails and you won't see the **SSL** selector.\n- **SSL**: This setting controls the `ssl-mode` connection string for the connection. Options include:\n  - **Allow**: Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `allow`. First try a non-SSL connection; if that fails, try an SSL connection.\n  - **Disable**: Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `disable`. Only try a non-SSL connection.\n  - **Require**: Sets the `ssl-mode` parameter to `require`, which is the default for TimescaleDB connection strings. Only try an SSL connection. If a root CA file is present, verify that a trusted certificate authority (CA) issued the server certificate.\n- **Port**: The port number of the TimescaleDB server.\n\nRefer to the [Timescale connection settings documentation](https://docs.tigerdata.com/integrations/latest/find-connection-details/) for more information about the non-SSL fields. Refer to [Connect with a stricter SSL](https://docs.tigerdata.com/use-timescale/latest/security/strict-ssl/) for more information about the SSL options.",
