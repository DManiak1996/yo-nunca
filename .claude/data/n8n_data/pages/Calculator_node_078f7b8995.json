  "content": "The Calculator node is a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) that allows an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to run mathematical calculations.\n\nParameter resolution in sub-nodes\n\nSub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.\n\nMost nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Build Your First AI Data Analyst Chatbot**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/3050-build-your-first-ai-data-analyst-chatbot/)\n\n**Chat with OpenAI Assistant (by adding a memory)**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2098-chat-with-openai-assistant-by-adding-a-memory/)\n\n**AI marketing report (Google Analytics & Ads, Meta Ads), sent via email/Telegram**\n\nby Friedemann Schuetz\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2783-ai-marketing-report-google-analytics-and-ads-meta-ads-sent-via-emailtelegram/)\n\n[Browse Calculator integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/calculator/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [LangChain's documentation on tools](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/tool-calling/) for more information about tools in LangChain.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
