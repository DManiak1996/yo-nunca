Depending on the use-case, it could be the User ID, List ID, and so on.\n\nFor this specific example, the List ID would be the Model ID:\n\n1. Open the Trello board that contains the list.\n1. If the list doesn't have any cards, add a card to the list.\n1. Open the card, add `.json` at the end of the URL, and press enter.\n1. In the JSON file, you will see a field called `idList`.\n1.
