Enter the name or IP address of your FTP server's **Host**.\n1. Enter the **Port** number the connection should use.\n1. Enter the **Username** the credential should connect as.\n1. Enter the user's **Password**.\n\nReview your FTP server provider's documentation for instructions on getting the information you need.\n\n## Using SFTP account\n\nUse this method if your FTP server supports SSH tunneling and encrypted connections.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need to:\n\n1. Enter the name or IP address of your FTP server's **Host**.\n1. Enter the **Port** number the connection should use.\n1. Enter the **Username** the credential should connect as.\n1.
