  "content": "You can add your own certificate authority (CA) or self-signed certificate to n8n. This means you are able to trust a certain SSL certificate instead of trusting all invalid certificates, which is a potential security risk.\n\nAdded in version 1.42.0\n\nThis feature is available in version 1.42.0 and above.\n\nTo use this feature you need to place your certificates in a folder and mount the folder to `/opt/custom-certificates` in the container. The external path that you map to `/opt/custom-certificates` must be writable by the container.\n\nThe examples below assume you have a folder called `pki` that contains your certificates in either the directory you run the command from or next to your docker compose file.\n\nWhen using the CLI you can use the `-v` flag from the command line:\n\nYou should also give the right permissions to the imported certs. You can do this once the container is running (assuming n8n as the container name):\n\n## Certificate requirements for Custom Trust Store\n\nSupported certificate types:\n\n- Root CA Certificates: these are certificates from Certificate Authorities that sign other certificates. Trust these to accept all certificates signed by that CA.\n- Self-Signed Certificates: certificates that servers create and sign themselves. Trust these to accept connections to that specific server only.\n\nYou must use PEM format:\n\n- Text-based format with BEGIN/END markers\n- Supported file extensions: `.pem`, `.crt`, `.cer`\n- Contains the public certificate (no private key needed)\n\nThe system doesn't accept:\n\n- DER/binary format files\n- PKCS#7 (.p7b) files\n- PKCS#12 (.pfx, .p12) files\n- Private key files\n- Convert these formats to PEM before use.",
