  "content": "This document lists the essential dependencies for developing a node, as well as guidance on setting up your editor.\n\nTo build and test a node, you need:\n\n- Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).\n- A local instance of n8n. You can install n8n with `npm install n8n -g`, then follow the steps in [Run your node locally](../../test/run-node-locally/) to test your node.\n- When [building verified community nodes](../../../community-nodes/build-community-nodes/), you must use the [`n8n-node` tool](../n8n-node/) to create and test your node.\n\nYou should also have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. This allows you to clone and use the [n8n-node-starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter).\n\nn8n recommends using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your editor.\n\nInstall these extensions:\n\n- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)\n- [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)\n- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)\n\nBy using VS Code and these extensions, you get access to the n8n node linter's warnings as you code.",
