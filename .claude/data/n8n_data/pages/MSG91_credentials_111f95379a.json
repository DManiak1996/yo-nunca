Refer to MSG91's [Where can I find my authentication key? documentation](https://msg91.com/help/api/where-can-i-find-my-authentication-ke) for more information.\n\nMSG91 enables [IP Security](https://msg91.com/help/api/what-do-you-mean-by-api-security) by default for authkeys.\n\nFor the n8n credentials to function with this setting enabled, add all the [n8n IP addresses](../../../../manage-cloud/cloud-ip/) as whitelisted IPs in MSG91. You can add them in one of two places, depending on your desired security level:\n\n- To allow any/all authkeys in the account to work with n8n, add the n8n IP addresses in the **Company's whitelisted IPs** section of the **Authkey** page.\n- To allow only specific authkeys to work with n8n, add the n8n IP addresses in the **Whitelisted IPs** section of an authkey's details.",
