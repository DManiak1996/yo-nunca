  "content": "You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:\n\n- [Linear Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.lineartrigger/)\n- [Linear](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.linear/)\n\nCreate a [Linear](https://linear.app/) account.\n\n## Supported authentication methods\n\nRefer to [Linear's API documentation](https://developers.linear.app/docs/graphql/working-with-the-graphql-api) for more information about the service.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- A personal **API Key**: Create a dedicated personal API key in your [**Settings** > **Security & access**](https://linear.app/n8n/settings/account/security). Refer to the [Linear Personal API keys documentation](https://linear.app/developers/graphql#personal-api-keys) for more information.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- A **Client ID**: Generated when you create a new OAuth2 application.\n- A **Client Secret**: Generated when you create a new OAuth2 application.\n- Select the **Actor**: The actor defines how the OAuth2 application should create issues, comments and other changes. Options include:\n  - **User** (Linear's default): The application creates resources as the authorizing user. Use this option if you want each user to do their own authentication.\n  - **Application**: The application creates resources as itself. Use this option if you have only one user (like an admin) authorizing the application.\n- To use this credential with the [Linear Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.lineartrigger/) node, you must enable the **Include Admin Scope** toggle.\n\nRefer to the [Linear OAuth2 Authentication documentation](https://developers.linear.app/docs/oauth/authentication) for more detailed instructions and explanations. Use the n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** as the **Redirect callback URL** in your Linear OAuth2 application.",
