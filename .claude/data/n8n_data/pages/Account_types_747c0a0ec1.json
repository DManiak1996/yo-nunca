  "content": "There are three account types: owner, admin, and member. The account type affects the user permissions and access.\n\nTo use admin accounts, you need a pro or enterprise plan.\n\nAccount types and role types\n\nAccount types and role types are different things. Role types are part of [RBAC](../rbac/).\n\nEvery account has one type. The account can have different [role types](../rbac/role-types/) for different [projects](../rbac/projects/).\n\nCreate a member-level account for the owner\n\nn8n recommends that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see and edit all workflows, credentials, and projects. However, there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.\n\n| Permission                                                          | Owner | Admin | Member |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----- | ------ |\n| Manage own email and password                                       |       |       |        |\n| Manage own workflows                                                |       |       |        |\n| View, create, and use tags                                          |       |       |        |\n| Delete tags                                                         |       |       |        |\n| View and share all workflows                                        |       |       |        |\n| View, edit, and share all credentials                               |       |       |        |\n| Set up and use [Source control](../../source-control-environments/) |       |       |        |\n| Create [projects](../rbac/projects/)                                |       |       |        |\n| View all projects                                                   |       |       |        |\n| Add and remove users                                                |       |       |        |\n| Access the Cloud dashboard                                          |       |       |        |",
