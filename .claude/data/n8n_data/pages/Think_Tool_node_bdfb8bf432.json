  "content": "The Think Tool node is a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) that invites an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to do some thinking before answering. Essentially, it allows the agent to reflect on the question by talking to itself before providing an answer. In particular, this is useful for complex queries that require a thoughtful response.\n\nParameter resolution in sub-nodes\n\nSub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.\n\nMost nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Generate AI Viral Videos with Seedance and Upload to TikTok, YouTube & Instagram**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/5338-generate-ai-viral-videos-with-seedance-and-upload-to-tiktok-youtube-and-instagram/)\n\n**Generate & Auto-post AI Videos to Social Media with Veo3 and Blotato**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/5035-generate-and-auto-post-ai-videos-to-social-media-with-veo3-and-blotato/)\n\n**Automated Stock Analysis Reports with Technical & News Sentiment using GPT-4o**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/3790-automated-stock-analysis-reports-with-technical-and-news-sentiment-using-gpt-4o/)\n\n[Browse Think Tool integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/think-tool/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\n### Prompting example\n\nAs an example, say you ask the agent:\n\n> *Jack is looking at Anne. Anne is looking at George. Jack is married, George is not, and we don't know if Anne is married. Is a married person looking at an unmarried person?*\n\nThe agent will do its thinking with the tool:\n\n> *We have the following information: 1. Jack is looking at Anne. 2. Anne is looking at George. 3. Jack is married. 4. George is not married. 5. We don't know if Anne is married or not.*\n>\n> *We need to determine if a married person is looking at an unmarried person. Let's consider both cases for Anne:*\n>\n> *Case 1: Anne is married.*\n>\n> - *If Anne is married, then she (married) is looking at George (unmarried). In this case, a married person (Anne) is looking at an unmarried person (George).*\n>\n> *Case 2: Anne is unmarried.*\n>\n> - *If Anne is unmarried, then Jack (married) is looking at Anne (unmarried). In this case, a married person (Jack) is looking at an unmarried person (Anne).*\n>\n> *In both scenarios, we find that a married person is looking at an unmarried person. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes.*\n\nand then afterward provide the answer:\n\n> *Yes, a married person is looking at an unmarried person. In both possible scenarios regarding Anne's marital status, we find that a married individual (either Jack or Anne) is looking at an unmarried individual (either George or Anne).*\n\nRefer to [LangChain's documentation on tools](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/tool-calling/) for more information about tools in LangChain.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
