Refer to [Google Authenticator | Key URI format](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format) for more information.\n\n## Using secret and label\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n- A **Secret**: The secret key encoded in the QR code during authenticator setup. It's an arbitrary key value encoded in Base32, for example: `BVDRSBXQB2ZEL5HE`. Refer to [Google Authenticator Secret](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format#secret) for more information.\n- A **Label**: The identifier for the account. It contains an account name as a URI-encoded string. You can include prefixes to identify the provider or service managing the account. If you use prefixes, use a literal or url-encoded colon to separate the issuer prefix and the account name, for example: `GitHub:john-doe`. Refer to [Google Authenticator Label](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format#label) for more information.",
