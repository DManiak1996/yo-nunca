  "content": "Vector databases store information as numbers:\n\n> A vector database is a type of database that stores data as high-dimensional vectors, which are mathematical representations of features or attributes. ([source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/memories/vector-db))\n\nThis enables fast and accurate similarity searches. With a vector database, instead of using conventional database queries, you can search for relevant data based on semantic and contextual meaning.\n\n## A simplified example\n\nA vector database could store the sentence \"n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host\", but instead of storing it as text, the vector database stores an array of dimensions (numbers between 0 and 1) that represent its features. This doesn't mean turning each letter in the sentence into a number. Instead, the vectors in the vector database describe the sentence.\n\nSuppose that in a vector store `0.1` represents `automation tool`, `0.2` represents `source available`, and `0.3` represents `can be self-hosted`. You could end up with the following vectors:\n\n| Sentence                                                         | Vector (array of dimensions) |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host | [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]              |\n| Zapier is an automation tool                                     | [0.1]                        |\n| Make is an automation tool                                       | [0.1]                        |\n| Confluence is a wiki tool that you can self-host                 | [0.3]                        |\n\nThis example is very simplified\n\nIn practice, vectors are far more complex. A vector can range in size from tens to thousands of dimensions. The dimensions don't have a one-to-one relationship to a single feature, so you can't translate individual dimensions directly into single concepts. This example gives an approximate mental model, not a true technical understanding.\n\n## Demonstrating the power of similarity search\n\nQdrant provides [vector search demos](https://qdrant.tech/demo/) to help users understand the power of vector databases. The [food discovery demo](https://food-discovery.qdrant.tech/) shows how a vector store can help match pictures based on visual similarities.\n\n> This demo uses data from Delivery Service. Users may like or dislike the photo of a dish, and the app will recommend more similar meals based on how they look. It's also possible to choose to view results from the restaurants within the delivery radius. ([source](https://qdrant.tech/demo/))\n\nFor full technical details, refer to the [Qdrant demo-food-discovery GitHub repository](https://github.com/qdrant/demo-food-discovery).\n\n## Embeddings, retrievers, text splitters, and document loaders\n\nVector databases require other tools to function:\n\n- Document loaders and text splitters: document loaders pull in documents and data, and prepare them for [embedding](../../../glossary/#ai-embedding). Document loaders can use text splitters to break documents into chunks.\n- Embeddings: these are the tools that turn the data (text, images, and so on) into vectors, and back into raw data. Note that n8n only supports text embeddings.\n- Retrievers: retrievers fetch documents from vector databases. You need to pair them with an embedding to translate the vectors back into data.",
