  "content": "Use the TheHive node to automate work in TheHive, and integrate TheHive with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of TheHive features, including creating alerts, counting tasks logs, cases, and observables.\n\nOn this page, you'll find a list of operations the TheHive node supports and links to more resources.\n\nTheHive and TheHive 5\n\nn8n provides two nodes for TheHive. Use this node (TheHive) if you want to use TheHive's version 3 or 4 API. If you want to use version 5, use [TheHive 5](../n8n-nodes-base.thehive5/).\n\nRefer to [TheHive credentials](../../credentials/thehive/) for guidance on setting up authentication.\n\nThe available operations depend on your API version. To see the operations list, create your credentials, including selecting your API version. Then return to the node, select the resource you want to use, and n8n displays the available operations for your API version.\n\n- Alert\n- Case\n- Log\n- Observable\n- Task\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Analyze emails with S1EM**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1602-analyze-emails-with-s1em/)\n\n**Weekly Shodan Query - Report Accidents**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1977-weekly-shodan-query-report-accidents/)\n\n**Create, update and get a case in TheHive**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/808-create-update-and-get-a-case-in-thehive/)\n\n[Browse TheHive integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/thehive/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\n## What to do if your operation isn't supported\n\nIf this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.\n\nYou can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:\n\n1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.\n1. Select the service you want to connect to.\n1. Select your credential.\n\nRefer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.\n\nn8n provides a trigger node for TheHive. You can find the trigger node docs [here](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.thehivetrigger/).\n\nRefer to TheHive's documentation for more information about the service:\n\n- [Version 3](https://docs.thehive-project.org/thehive/legacy/thehive3/api/)\n- [Version 4](https://docs.thehive-project.org/cortex/api/api-guide/)",
