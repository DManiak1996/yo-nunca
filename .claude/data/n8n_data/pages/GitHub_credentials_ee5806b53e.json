[Generate a GitHub personal access token](#generate-personal-access-token).\n1. [Set up the credential](#set-up-the-credential).\n\nRefer to the sections below for detailed instructions.\n\n### Generate personal access token\n\nRecommended access token type\n\nn8n recommends using a personal access token (classic). GitHub's fine-grained personal access tokens are still in beta and can't access all endpoints.\n\nTo generate your personal access token:\n\n1. If you haven't done so already, verify your email address with GitHub. Refer to [Verifying your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address) for more information.\n1. Open your GitHub profile [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile).\n1. In the left navigation, select [**Developer settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps).\n1. In the left navigation, under **Personal access tokens**, select **Tokens (classic)**.\n1. Select **Generate new token > Generate new token (classic)**.\n1. Enter a descriptive name for your token in the **Note** field, like `n8n integration`.\n1. Select the **Expiration** you'd like for the token, or select **No expiration**.\n1. Select **Scopes** for your token. For most of the n8n GitHub nodes, add the `repo` scope.\n   - A token without assigned scopes can only access public information.\n   - Refer to\n1. Select **Generate token**.\n1. Copy the token.\n\nRefer to [Creating a personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) for more information. Refer to [Scopes for OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes) for more information on GitHub scopes.\n\n### Set up the credential\n\nThen, in your n8n credential:\n\n1. If you aren't using GitHub Enterprise Server, don't change the **GitHub server** URL.\n   - If you're using [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server), update **GitHub server** to match the URL for your server.\n1. Enter your **User** name as it appears in your GitHub profile.\n1. Enter the **Access Token** you generated above.\n\nNote for n8n Cloud users\n\nCloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.\n\nIf you're [self-hosting n8n](../../../../hosting/), create a new GitHub [OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps):\n\n1. Open your GitHub profile [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile).\n1. In the left navigation, select [**Developer settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps).\n1. In the left navigation, select **OAuth apps**.\n1. Select **New OAuth App**.\n   - If you haven't created an app before, you may see **Register a new application** instead. Select it.\n1. Enter an **Application name**, like `n8n integration`.\n1. Enter the **Homepage URL** for your app's website.\n1. If you'd like, add the optional **Application description**, which GitHub displays to end-users.\n1. From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and paste it into the GitHub **Authorization callback URL**.\n1. Select **Register application**.\n1. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** this generates and add them to your n8n credential.\n\nRefer to the [GitHub Authorizing OAuth apps documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps) for more information on the authorization process.",
