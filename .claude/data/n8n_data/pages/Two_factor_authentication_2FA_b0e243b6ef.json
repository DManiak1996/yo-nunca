Select **Enable 2FA**. n8n opens a modal with a QR code.\n1. Scan the QR code in your authenticator app.\n1. Enter the code from your app in **Code from authenticator app**.\n1. Select **Continue**. n8n displays recovery codes.\n1. Save the recovery codes. You need these to regain access to your account if you lose your authenticator.\n\n## Disable 2FA for your instance\n\nSelf-hosted users can configure their n8n instance to disable 2FA for all users by setting `N8N_MFA_ENABLED` to false. Note that n8n ignores this if existing users have 2FA enabled. Refer to [Configuration methods](../../hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on configuring your n8n instance with environment variables.",
