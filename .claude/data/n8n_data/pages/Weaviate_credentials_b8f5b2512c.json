Refer to [Weaviate's authentication documentation](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/configuration/authentication#api-key-authentication) for information on creating and using API keys.\n\nYou can then provide the arguments for your custom connection:\n\n- **Weaviate Api Key**: Your Weaviate API key.\n- **Custom Connection HTTP Host**: The domain name or IP address of your Weaviate instance to use for HTTP API calls.\n- **Custom Connection HTTP Port**: The port your Weaviate instance is running on for HTTP API calls. By default, this is 8080.\n- **Custom Connection HTTP Secure**: Whether to connect to the Weaviate through HTTPS for HTTP API calls.\n- **Custom Connection gRPC Host**: The hostname or IP address of your Weaviate instance to use for gRPC.\n- **Custom Connection gRPC Port**: The gRPC API port for your Weaviate instance. By default, this is 50051.\n- **Custom Connection gRPC Secure**: Whether to connect to the Weaviate through HTTPS for gRPC.\n\nFor community support, refer to [Weaviate Forums](https://forum.weaviate.io/).",
