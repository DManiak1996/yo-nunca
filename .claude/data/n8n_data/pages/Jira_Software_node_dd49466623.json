When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).\n\n- Issue\n  - Get issue changelog\n  - Create a new issue\n  - Delete an issue\n  - Get an issue\n  - Get all issues\n  - Create an email notification for an issue and add it to the mail queue\n  - Return either all transitions or a transition that can be performed by the user on an issue, based on the issue's status\n  - Update an issue\n- Issue Attachment\n  - Add attachment to issue\n  - Get an attachment\n  - Get all attachments\n  - Remove an attachment\n- Issue Comment\n  - Add comment to issue\n  - Get a comment\n  - Get all comments\n  - Remove a comment\n  - Update a comment\n- User\n  - Create a new user.\n  - Delete a user.\n  - Retrieve a user.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Automate Customer Support Issue Resolution using AI Text Classifier**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2468-automate-customer-support-issue-resolution-using-ai-text-classifier/)\n\n**Create a new issue in Jira**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/459-create-a-new-issue-in-jira/)\n\n**Analyze & Sort Suspicious Email Contents with ChatGPT**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2666-analyze-and-sort-suspicious-email-contents-with-chatgpt/)\n\n[Browse Jira Software integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/jira-software/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\n## What to do if your operation isn't supported\n\nIf this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.\n\nYou can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:\n\n1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.\n1. Select the service you want to connect to.\n1. Select your credential.\n\nRefer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.\n\nRefer to the [official JQL documentation](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/expand-jira/jql) about Jira Query Language (JQL) to learn more about it.\n\n## Fetch issues for a specific project\n\nThe **Get All** operation returns all the issues from Jira. To fetch issues for a particular project, you need to use Jira Query Language (JQL).\n\nFor example, if you want to receive all the issues of a project named `n8n`, you'd do something like this:\n\n- Select **Get All** from the **Operation** dropdown list.\n- Toggle **Return All** to true.\n- Select **Add Option** and select **JQL**.\n- Enter `project=n8n` in the **JQL** field.\n\nThis query will fetch all the issues in the project named `n8n`. Enter the name of your project instead of `n8n` to fetch all the issues for your project.",
