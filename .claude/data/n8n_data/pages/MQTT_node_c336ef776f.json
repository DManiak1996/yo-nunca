  "content": "Use the MQTT node to automate work in MQTT, and integrate MQTT with other applications. n8n supports transporting messages with MQTT.\n\nOn this page, you'll find a list of operations the MQTT node supports and links to more resources.\n\nRefer to [MQTT credentials](../../credentials/mqtt/) for guidance on setting up authentication.\n\nThis node can be used as an AI tool\n\nThis node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).\n\nUse the MQTT node to send a message. You can set the message topic, and choose whether to send the node input data as part of the message.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**IOT Button Remote / Spotify Control Integration with MQTT**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2383-iot-button-remote-spotify-control-integration-with-mqtt/)\n\n**Receive messages for a MQTT queue**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/657-receive-messages-for-a-mqtt-queue/)\n\n**Send location updates of the ISS to a topic in MQTT**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1069-send-location-updates-of-the-iss-to-a-topic-in-mqtt/)\n\n[Browse MQTT integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/mqtt/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nn8n provides a trigger node for MQTT.
