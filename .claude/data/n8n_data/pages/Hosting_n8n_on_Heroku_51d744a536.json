  "title": "Hosting n8n on Heroku",
  "content": "This hosting guide shows you how to self-host n8n on Heroku. It uses:\n\n- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to create and define the application components and how they work together.\n- [Heroku's PostgreSQL service](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/heroku-postgres) to host n8n's data storage.\n- A **Deploy to Heroku** button offering a one click, with minor configuration, deployment.\n\nSelf-hosting knowledge prerequisites\n\nSelf-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:\n\n- Setting up and configuring servers and containers\n- Managing application resources and scaling\n- Securing servers and applications\n- Configuring n8n\n\nn8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).\n\nLatest and Next versions\n\nn8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).\n\nCurrent `latest`: 1.118.1\\\nCurrent `next`: 1.119.0\n\n## Use the deployment template to create a Heroku project\n\nThe quickest way to get started with deploying n8n to Heroku is using the **Deploy to Heroku** button:\n\nThis opens the **Create New App** page on Heroku. Set a name for the project, and choose the region to deploy the project to.\n\n### Configure environment variables\n\nHeroku pre-fills the configuration options defined in the `env` section of the `app.json` file, which also sets default values for the environment variables n8n uses.\n\nYou can change any of these values to suit your needs. You must change the following values:\n\n- **N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY**, which n8n uses to [encrypt user account details](../../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) before saving to the database.\n- **WEBHOOK_URL** should match the application name you create to ensure that webhooks have the correct URL.\n\nSelect **Deploy app**.\n\nAfter Heroku builds and deploys the app it provides links to **Manage App** or **View** the application.\n\nRefer to the [Heroku documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/networking-dns) to find out how to connect your domain to a Heroku application.\n\n## Changing the deployment template\n\nYou can make changes to the deployment template by forking the [repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-heroku) and deploying from you fork.\n\nBy default the Dockerfile pulls the latest n8n image, if you want to use a different or fixed version, then update the image tag on the top line of the `Dockerfile`.\n\n### Heroku and exposing ports\n\nHeroku doesn't allow Docker-based applications to define an exposed port with the `EXPOSE` command. Instead, Heroku provides a `PORT` environment variable that it dynamically populates at application runtime. The `entrypoint.sh` file overrides the default Docker image command to instead set the port variable that Heroku provides. You can then access n8n on port 80 in a web browser.\n\nDocker limitations with Heroku\n\n[Read this guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime#unsupported-dockerfile-commands) for more details on the limitations of using Docker with Heroku.\n\n### Configuring Heroku\n\nThe `heroku.yml` file defines the application you want to create on Heroku. It consists of two sections:\n\n- `setup` > `addons` defines the Heroku addons to use. In this case, the PostgreSQL database addon.\n- The `build` section defines how Heroku builds the application. In this case it uses the Docker buildpack to build a `web` service based on the supplied `Dockerfile`.\n\n- Learn more about [configuring](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../../scaling/overview/) n8n.\n- Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](../../../../try-it-out/).",
