  "content": "Use the Embeddings OpenAI node to generate [embeddings](../../../../../glossary/#ai-embedding) for a given text.\n\nOn this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings OpenAI node, and links to more resources.\n\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/openai/).\n\nParameter resolution in sub-nodes\n\nSub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.\n\nMost nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n- **Model**: Select the model to use for generating embeddings.\n- **Base URL**: Enter the URL to send the request to. Use this if you are using a self-hosted OpenAI-like model.\n- **Batch Size**: Enter the maximum number of documents to send in each request.\n- **Strip New Lines**: Select whether to remove new line characters from input text (turned on) or not (turned off). n8n enables this by default.\n- **Timeout**: Enter the maximum amount of time a request can take in seconds. Set to `-1` for no timeout.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n**Building Your First WhatsApp Chatbot**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/)\n\n**Ask questions about a PDF using AI**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/)\n\n**Chat with PDF docs using AI (quoting sources)**\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2165-chat-with-pdf-docs-using-ai-quoting-sources/)\n\n[Browse Embeddings OpenAI integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/embeddings-openai/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [LangChains's OpenAI embeddings documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/text_embedding/openai/) for more information about the service.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.",
