Refer to [Mailchimp's Generate your API key documentation](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/quick-start/#generate-your-api-key) for more detailed instructions.\n\nNote for n8n Cloud users\n\nCloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.\n\nIf you need to configure OAuth2 from scratch, [register an application](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/access-user-data-oauth-2/#register-your-application). Refer to the [Mailchimp OAuth2 documentation](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/access-user-data-oauth-2/) for more information.\n\n## Selecting an authentication method\n\nMailchimp suggests using an API key if you're only accessing your own Mailchimp account's data:\n\n> Use an API key if you're writing code that tightly couples *your* application's data to *your* Mailchimp account's data. If you ever need to access *someone else's* Mailchimp account's data, you should be using OAuth 2 ([source](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/access-user-data-oauth-2/#when-not-to-use-oauth-2))",
