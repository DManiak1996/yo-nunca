Common status codes are:\n\n* `200`: Success\n* `400`: Bad Request (missing parameters, invalid JSON, etc.)\n* `404`: Not Found (model doesn't exist, etc.)\n* `429`: Too Many Requests (e.g. when a rate limit is exceeded)\n* `500`: Internal Server Error\n* `502`: Bad Gateway (e.g. when a cloud model cannot be reached)\n\nErrors are returned in the `application/json` format with the following structure, with the error message in the `error` property:\n\n## Errors that occur while streaming\n\nIf an error occurs mid-stream, the error will be returned as an object in the `application/x-ndjson` format with an `error` property. Since the response has already started, the status code of the response will not be changed.",
