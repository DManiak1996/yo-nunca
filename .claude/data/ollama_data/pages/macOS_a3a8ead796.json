Upon startup, the Ollama app will verify the `ollama` CLI is present in your PATH, and if not detected, will prompt for permission to create a link in `/usr/local/bin`\n\nOnce you've installed Ollama, you'll need additional space for storing the Large Language models, which can be tens to hundreds of GB in size.  If your home directory doesn't have enough space, you can change where the binaries are installed, and where the models are stored.\n\n### Changing Install Location\n\nTo install the Ollama application somewhere other than `Applications`, place the Ollama application in the desired location, and ensure the CLI `Ollama.app/Contents/Resources/ollama` or a sym-link to the CLI can be found in your path.  Upon first start decline the \"Move to Applications?\" request.\n\nOllama on MacOS stores files in a few different locations.\n\n* `~/.ollama` contains models and configuration\n* `~/.ollama/logs` contains logs\n  * *app.log* contains most recent logs from the GUI application\n  * *server.log* contains the most recent server logs\n* `<install location>/Ollama.app/Contents/Resources/ollama` the CLI binary\n\nTo fully remove Ollama from your system, remove the following files and folders:",
