# Releases

Version history for this repository (75 releases).

## v0.11.0: v0.11.0
**Published:** 2025-10-02

## Highlights
This release features 538 commits, 207 contributors (65 new contributors)!

* This release completes the removal of V0 engine. V0 engine code including AsyncLLMEngine, LLMEngine, MQLLMEngine, all attention backends, and related components have been removed. **V1 is the only engine in the codebase now.**
* This releases turns on **FULL_AND_PIECEWISE as the CUDA graph mode default**. This should provide better out of the box performance for most models, particularly fine-grained MoEs, while preserving compatibility with existing models supporting only PIECEWISE mode.

Note: In v0.11.0 (and v0.10.2), `--async-scheduling` will produce gibberish output in some cases such as preemption and others. This functionality is correct in v0.10.1. We are actively fixing it for the next version.

* **Configuration enhancements**: Formalized --mm-encoder-tp-mode flag (#23190), VLLM_DISABLE_PAD_FOR_CUDAGRAPH environment variable (#23595), EPLB configuration parameter (#20562), embedding endpoint chat request support (#23931), and LM Format Enforcer V1 integration (#22564).

### Dependencies
* **Major updates**: PyTorch 2.8.0 upgrade (#20358) - breaking change requiring environment updates, FlashInfer v0.3.0 upgrade (#24086), and FlashInfer 0.2.14.post1 maintenance update (#23537).
* **Supporting updates**: XGrammar 0.1.23 (#22988), TPU core dump fix with tpu_info 0.4.0 (#23135), and compressed tensors version bump (#23202).
* **Deployment improvements**: FlashInfer cubin directory environment variable (#22675) for offline environments and pre-cached CUDA binaries.

### V0 Deprecation
* **Backend removals**: V0 Neuron backend deprecation (#21159), V0 pooling model support removal (#23434), V0 FlashInfer attention backend removal (#22776), and V0 test cleanup (#23418, #23862).
* **API breaking changes**: prompt_token_ids fallback removal from LLM.generate and LLM.embed (#18800), LoRA extra vocab size deprecation warning (#23635), LoRA bias parameter deprecation (#24339), and metrics naming change from TPOT to ITL (#24110).

### Breaking Changes
1. **PyTorch 2.8.0 upgrade** - Environment dependency change requiring updated CUDA versions
2. **FlashMLA Blackwell restriction** - FlashMLA disabled on Blackwell GPUs due to compatibility issues
3. **V0 feature removals** - Neuron backend, pooling models, FlashInfer attention backend
5. **Quantizations** - Removed quantized Mixtral hack implementation, and original Marlin format. 
6. **Metrics renaming** - TPOT deprecated in favor of ITL

## v0.10.1: v0.10.1
**Published:** 2025-08-18

## Highlights
v0.10.1 release includes 727 commits, 245 committers (105 new contributors). 

**NOTE: This release deprecates V0 FA3 support and as a result FP8 kv-cache in V0 may have issues** 

### Model Support
* **New model families**: GPT-OSS with comprehensive tool calling and streaming support (#22327, #22330, #22332, #22335, #22339, #22340, #22342), Command-A-Vision (#22660), mBART (#22883), and SmolLM3 using Transformers backend (#22665).
* **Vision-language models**: Official Eagle multimodal support with Llama4 backend (#20788), Step3 vision-language models (#21998), Gemma3n multimodal (#20495), MiniCPM-V 4.0 (#22166), HyperCLOVAX-SEED-Vision-Instruct-3B (#20931), Emu3 with Transformers backend (#21319), Intern-S1 (#21628), and Prithvi in online serving mode (#21518).
* **Enhanced existing models**: NemotronH support (#22349), Ernie 4.5 Base 0.3B model name change (#21735), GLM-4.5 series improvements (#22215), Granite models with fused MoE configurations (#21332) and quantized checkpoint loading (#22925), Ultravox support for Llama 4 and Gemma 3 backends (#17818), Mamba1 and Jamba model support in V1 (without CUDA graphs) (#21249)
* **Advanced model capabilities**: Qwen3 EPLB (#20815) and dual-chunk attention support (#21924), Qwen native Eagle3 target support (#22333).
* **Architecture expansions**: Encoder-only models without KV-cache enabling BERT-style architectures (#21270), expanded tensor parallelism support in Transformers backend (#22651), tensor parallelism for Deepseek_vl2 vision transformer (#21494), and tensor/pipeline parallelism with Mamba2 kernel for PLaMo2 (#19674).
* **V1 engine compatibility**: Extended support for additional pooling models (#21747) and Step3VisionEncoder distributed processing option (#22697).

### Engine Core
* **CUDA graph performance**: Full CUDA graph support with separate attention routines, adding FA2 and FlashInfer compatibility (#20059), plus 6% end-to-end throughput improvement from Cutlass MLA (#22763).

* **User experience enhancements**: Improved error messaging for multimodal items (#22114), per-request pooling control via PoolingParams (#20538).

### Dependencies
* **FlashInfer updates**: Updated to v0.2.8 for improved performance (#21385), moved to optional dependency install with `pip install vllm[flashinfer]` for flexible installation (#21959).
* **Mamba SSM restructuring**: Updated to version 2.2.5 (#21421), removed from core requirements to reduce installation complexity (#22541).
* **Docker and deployment**: Docker-aware precompiled wheel support for easier containerized deployment (#21127, #22106).
* **Python package updates**: OpenAI Python dependency updated to latest version for API compatibility (#22316).
* **Dependency optimizations**: Removed xformers requirement for Mistral-format Pixtral and Mistral3 models (#21154), deprecation warnings added for old DeepGEMM version (#22194).

### V0 Deprecation
**Important**: As part of the ongoing V0 engine cleanup, several breaking changes have been introduced:
* **CLI flag updates**: Replaced `--task` with `--runner` and `--convert` options (#21470), deprecated `--disable-log-requests` in favor of `--enable-log-requests` for clearer semantics (#21739), renamed `--expand-tools-even-if-tool-choice-none` to `--exclude-tools-when-tool-choice-none` for consistency (#20544).
* **API cleanup**: Removed previously deprecated arguments and methods as part of ongoing V0 engine codebase cleanup (#21907).

## v0.9.2: v0.9.2
**Published:** 2025-07-07

## Highlights

This release contains 452 commits from 167 contributors (31 new!)

**NOTE: This is the last version where V0 engine code and features stay intact. We highly recommend migrating to V1 engine.**

### Engine Core
* Priority Scheduling is now implemented in V1 engine (#19057), embedding models in V1 (#16188),  Mamba2 in V1 (#19327). 
* Full CUDA‑Graph execution is now available for all FlashAttention v3 (FA3) and FlashMLA paths, including prefix‑caching. CUDA graph now has a live capture progress bar makes debugging easier (#20301, #18581, #19617, #19501).  
* FlexAttention update – any head size, FP32 fallback (#20467, #19754).  
* Shared `CachedRequestData` objects and cached sampler‑ID stores deliver perf enhancements (#20232, #20291).  

### Model Support
* New families: Ernie 4.5 (+MoE) (#20220), MiniMax‑M1 (#19677, #20297), Slim‑MoE “Phi‑tiny‑MoE‑instruct” (#20286), Tencent HunYuan‑MoE‑V1 (#20114), Keye‑VL‑8B‑Preview (#20126), GLM‑4.1 V (#19331), Gemma‑3 (text‑only, #20134), Tarsier 2 (#19887), Qwen 3 Embedding & Reranker (#19260), dots1 (#18254), GPT‑2 for Sequence Classification (#19663).  
* Granite hybrid MoE configurations with shared experts are fully supported (#19652).  

### Large‑Scale Serving & Engine Improvements
* Expert‑Parallel Load Balancer (EPLB) has been added! (#18343, #19790, #19885).  
* Disaggregated serving enhancements: Avoid stranding blocks in P when aborted in D's waiting queue (#19223), let toy proxy handle /chat/completions (#19730) 
* Native xPyD P2P NCCL transport as a base case for native PD without external dependency (#18242, #20246).  

### Hardware & Performance
* NVIDIA Blackwell 
	* SM120: CUTLASS W8A8/FP8 kernels and related tuning, added to Dockerfile (#17280, #19566, #20071, #19794) 
	* SM100: block‑scaled‑group GEMM, INT8/FP8 vectorization, deep‑GEMM kernels, activation‑chunking for MoE, and group‑size 64 for Machete (#19757, #19572, #19168, #19085, #20290, #20331).  
* Intel GPU (V1) backend with Flash‑Attention support (#19560).  
* AMD ROCm: full‑graph capture for TritonAttention, quick All‑Reduce, and chunked pre‑fill (#19158, #19744, #18596).  
	* Split‑KV support landed in the unified Triton Attention kernel, boosting long‑context throughput (#19152).  
	* Full‑graph mode enabled in ROCm AITER MLA V1 decode path (#20254).  
* TPU: dynamic‑grid KV‑cache updates, head‑dim less than 128, tuned paged‑attention kernels, and KV‑padding fixes (#19928, #20235, #19620, #19813, #20048, #20339).  
	* Add models and features supporting matrix. (#20230) 

### Quantization
* Calibration‑free RTN INT4/INT8 pipeline for effortless, accurate compression (#18768).  
* Compressed‑Tensor NVFP4 (including MoE) + emulation; FP4 emulation removed on < SM100 devices (#19879, #19990, #19563).  
* Dynamic MoE‑layer quant (Marlin/GPTQ) and INT8 vectorization primitives (#19395, #20331, #19233).  
* Bits‑and‑Bytes 0.45 + with improved double‑quant logic and AWQ quality (#20424, #20033, #19431, #20076).

### API · CLI · Frontend
* API Server: Eliminate api_key and x_request_id headers middleware overhead (#19946) 
* New OpenAI‑compatible endpoints: `/v1/audio/translations` & revamped `/v1/audio/transcriptions` (#19615, #20179, #19597).  
* Token‑level progress bar for `LLM.beam_search` and cached template‑resolution speed‑ups (#19301, #20065).  
* Image‑object support in `llm.chat`, tool‑choice expansion, and custom‑arg passthroughs enrich multi‑modal agents (#19635, #17177, #16862).  
* CLI QoL: better parsing for `-O/--compilation-config`, batch‑size‑sweep benchmarking, richer `--help`, faster startup (#20156, #20516, #20430, #19941).
* Metrics: Deprecate metrics with gpu_ prefix for non GPU specific metrics (#18354), Export NaNs in logits to scheduler_stats if output is corrupted (#18777) 

### Platform & Deployment
* No‑privileged CPU / Docker / K8s mode (#19241) and custom default max‑tokens for hosted platforms (#18557).  
* Security hardening – runtime (cloud)pickle imports forbidden (#18018).  
* Hermetic builds and wheel slimming (FA2 8.0 + PTX only) shrink supply‑chain surface (#18064, #19336).

## v0.9.0: v0.9.0
**Published:** 2025-05-15

## Highlights
This release features 649 commits, from 215 contributors (82 new contributors!)

* vLLM has upgraded to PyTorch 2.7!  (#16859) This is a breaking change for environment dependency.
	* The default wheel has been upgraded from CUDA 12.4 to CUDA 12.8. We will distribute CUDA 12.6 wheel on GitHub artifact. 
	* As a general rule of thumb, our CUDA version policy follow PyTorch's CUDA version policy. 
* Enhanced NVIDIA Blackwell support. vLLM now ships with initial set of optimized kernels on NVIDIA Blackwell with both attention and mlp. 
	* You can use our docker image or install FlashInfer nightly wheel `pip install https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128/flashinfer/flashinfer_python-0.2.5%2Bcu128torch2.7-cp38-abi3-linux_x86_64.whl` then set `VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND=FLASHINFER` for better performance.
	* Upgraded support for the new FlashInfer main branch. (#15777)
	* Please checkout https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/18153 for the full roadmap 
* Initial DP, EP, PD support for large scale inference
	* EP:
		* Permute and unpermute kernel for moe optimization (#14568)
		* Modularize fused experts and integrate PPLX kernels (#15956)
		* Refactor pplx init logic to make it modular (prepare for deepep) (#18200)
		* Add ep group and all2all interface (#18077)
	* DP:
		* Decouple engine process management and comms (#15977)
	* PD:
		* NIXL Integration (#17751)
		* Local attention optimization for NIXL (#18170)
		* Support multiple kv connectors (#17564)
* Migrate docs from Sphinx to MkDocs (#18145, #18610, #18614, #18616. #18622, #18626, #18627, #18635, #18637, #18657, #18663, #18666, #18713)

### Notable Changes
* Removal of CUDA 12.4 support due to PyTorch upgrade to 2.7. 
* Change `top_k` to be disabled with `0` (still accept `-1` for now) (#17773)
* The seed is now set to `0` by default for V1 Engine, meaning that different vLLM runs now yield the same outputs even if `temperature > 0`. This does not modify the random state in user code since workers are run in separate processes unless `VLLM_USE_V1_MULTIPROCESSING=0`. (#17929, #18741)

### Model Enhancements
* Support MiMo-7B (#17433), MiniMax-VL-01 (#16328), Ovis 1.6 (#17861), Ovis 2 (#15826), GraniteMoeHybrid 4.0 (#17497), FalconH1\* (#18406), LlamaGuard4 (#17315)
  * Please install the development version of `transformers` (from source) to use Falcon-H1.
* Embedding models: nomic-embed-text-v2-moe (#17785), new class of gte models (#17986)
* Progress in Hybrid Memory Allocator (#17394, #17479, #17474, #17483, #17193, #17946, #17945, #17999, #18001, #18593)
* DeepSeek: perf enhancement by moving more calls into cuda-graph region(#17484, #17668), Function Call (#17784), MTP in V1 (#18435)
* Qwen2.5-1M: Implements dual-chunk-flash-attn backend for dual chunk attention with sparse attention support (#11844)
* Qwen2.5-VL speed enhancement via rotary_emb optimization (#17973)
* InternVL models with Qwen2.5 backbone now support video inputs (#18499)

## v0.8.0: v0.8.0
**Published:** 2025-03-18

v0.8.0 featured 523 commits from 166 total contributors (68 new contributors)! 

## Highlights

### V1

We have now enabled V1 engine by default (#13726) for supported use cases. Please refer to [V1 user guide](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/v1_user_guide.html) for more detail. We expect better performance for supported scenarios. If you'd like to disable V1 mode, please specify the environment variable `VLLM_USE_V1=0`, and send us a GitHub issue sharing the reason!

## v0.7.2: v0.7.2
**Published:** 2025-02-06

## Highlights

* Qwen2.5-VL is now supported in vLLM. Please note that it requires a source installation from Hugging Face `transformers` library at the moment (#12604)
* Add `transformers` backend support via `--model-impl=transformers`. This allows vLLM to be ran with arbitrary Hugging Face text models (#11330, #12785, #12727). 
* Performance enhancement to DeepSeek models. 
	* Align KV caches entries to start 256 byte boundaries, yielding 43% throughput enhancement (#12676)
	* Apply `torch.compile` to fused_moe/grouped_topk, yielding 5% throughput enhancement (#12637)
	* Enable MLA for DeepSeek VL2 (#12729)
	* Enable DeepSeek model on ROCm (#12662)

### Core Engine
* Use `VLLM_LOGITS_PROCESSOR_THREADS` to speed up structured decoding in high batch size scenarios (#12368)

### Security Update
* Improve hash collision avoidance in prefix caching (#12621)
* Add SPDX-License-Identifier headers to python source files (#12628)

### Other
* Enable FusedSDPA support for Intel Gaudi (HPU) (#12359)

## v0.6.6: v0.6.6
**Published:** 2024-12-27

## Highlights
* Support Deepseek V3 (#11523, #11502) model. 
	* On 8xH200s or MI300x: `vllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 --tensor-parallel-size 8 --trust-remote-code --max-model-len 8192`. The context length can be increased to about 32K beyond running into memory issue.
	* For other devices, follow our [distributed inference](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/distributed_serving.html) guide to enable tensor parallel and/or pipeline parallel inference
	* We are just getting started for enhancing the support and unlock more performance. See #11539 for planned work. 
* Last mile stretch for V1 engine refactoring: API Server (#11529, #11530), penalties for sampler (#10681), prefix caching for vision language models (#11187, #11305), TP Ray executor (#11107,#11472)

* Breaking change: `X-Request-ID` echoing is now opt-in instead of on by default for performance reason. Set `--enable-request-id-headers` to enable it.

### Model Support
* IBM Granite 3.1 (#11307), JambaForSequenceClassification model  (#10860)
* Add `QVQ` and `QwQ` to the list of supported models (#11509)


### Performance
* Cutlass 2:4 Sparsity + FP8/INT8 Quant Support (#10995)


### Production Engine
* Support streaming model from S3 using RunAI Model Streamer as optional loader (#10192)
* Online Pooling API (#11457)
* Load video from base64 (#11492)

### Others
* Add pypi index for every commit and nightly build (#11404)

	* Spec decode removing batch expansion (#8839, #9298).
	* We have made block manager V2 the default. This is an internal refactoring for cleaner and more tested code path (#8678).
	* Moving beam search from the core to the API level (#9105, #9087, #9117, #8928)
	* Move guided decoding params into sampling params (#8252)
* Torch Compile:
	* You can now set an env var `VLLM_TORCH_COMPILE_LEVEL` to control `torch.compile` various levels of compilation control and integration (#9058). Along with various improvements (#8982, #9258, #906, #8875), using `VLLM_TORCH_COMPILE_LEVEL=3` can turn on Inductor's full graph compilation without vLLM's custom ops. 

### Others
* Performance enhancements to turn on multi-step scheeduling by default (#8804, #8645, #8378)
* Enhancements towards priority scheduling (#8965, #8956, #8850)

---

## v0.6.2: v0.6.2
**Published:** 2024-09-25

## Highlights

### Model Support
* Support Llama 3.2 models (#8811, #8822)
	```
	vllm serve meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct --enforce-eager --max-num-seqs 16
	```
* Beam search have been soft deprecated. We are moving towards a version of beam search that's more performant and also simplifying vLLM's core. (#8684, #8763, #8713)
  * ⚠️ You will see the following error now, this is breaking change!

    > Using beam search as a sampling parameter is deprecated, and will be removed in the future release. Please use the `vllm.LLM.use_beam_search` method for dedicated beam search instead, or set the environment variable `VLLM_ALLOW_DEPRECATED_BEAM_SEARCH=1` to suppress this error. For more details, see https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/8306

## v0.6.0: v0.6.0
**Published:** 2024-09-04

## Highlights

### Performance Update
* We are excited to announce a faster vLLM delivering 2x more throughput compared to v0.5.3. The default parameters should achieve great speed up, but we recommend also try out turning on multi step scheduling. You can do so by setting `--num-scheduler-steps 8` in the engine arguments. Please note that it still have some limitations and being actively hardened, see #7528 for known issues. 
	* Multi-step scheduler now supports LLMEngine and log_probs (#7789, #7652)
	* Asynchronous output processor overlaps the output data structures construction with GPU works, delivering 12% throughput increase. (#7049, #7911, #7921, #8050)
	* Using FlashInfer backend for FP8 KV Cache (#7798, #7985), rejection sampling in Speculative Decoding (#7244)

### Model Support
* Support bitsandbytes 8-bit and FP4 quantized models (#7445)
* New LLMs: Exaone (#7819), Granite (#7436), Phi-3.5-MoE (#7729)
* A new tokenizer mode for mistral models to use the native mistral-commons package (#7739)
* Multi-modality: 
	* multi-image input support for LLaVA-Next (#7230), Phi-3-vision models (#7783)
	* Ultravox support for multiple audio chunks (#7963)
	* TP support for ViTs (#7186)

### Hardware Support
* NVIDIA GPU: extend cuda graph size for H200 (#7894)
* AMD: Triton implementations awq_dequantize and awq_gemm to support AWQ (#7386)
* Intel GPU: pipeline parallel support (#7810)
* Neuron: context lengths and token generation buckets (#7885, #8062)
* TPU: single and multi-host TPUs on GKE (#7613), Async output processing (#8011)

### Production Features
* OpenAI-Compatible Tools API + Streaming for Hermes & Mistral models! (#5649)
* Add json_schema support from OpenAI protocol (#7654)
* Enable chunked prefill and prefix caching together (#7753, #8120)
* Multimodal support in offline chat (#8098), and multiple multi-modal items in the OpenAI frontend (#8049)

### Misc
* Support benchmarking async engine in benchmark_throughput.py (#7964)
* Progress in integration with `torch.compile`: avoid Dynamo guard evaluation overhead (#7898), skip compile for profiling (#7796)

## v0.5.5: v0.5.5
**Published:** 2024-08-23

## Highlights

### Performance Update
* We introduced a new mode that schedule multiple GPU steps in advance, reducing CPU overhead (#7000, #7387, #7452, #7703). Initial result shows 20% improvements in QPS for a single GPU running 8B and 30B models. You can set `--num-scheduler-steps 8` as a parameter to the API server (via `vllm serve`) or `AsyncLLMEngine`. We are working on expanding the coverage to `LLM` class and aiming to turning it on by default
* Various enhancements:
  * Use flashinfer sampling kernel when avaiable, leading to 7% decoding throughput speedup (#7137)
  * Reduce Python allocations, leading to 24% throughput speedup (#7162, 7364)
  * Improvements to the zeromq based decoupled frontend (#7570, #7716, #7484)

### Model Support
* Support Jamba 1.5 (#7415, #7601, #6739)
* Support for the first audio model `UltravoxModel` (#7615, #7446)
* Improvements to vision models:
    * Support image embeddings as input (#6613)
    * Support SigLIP encoder and alternative decoders for LLaVA models (#7153)
* Support loading GGUF model (#5191) with tensor parallelism (#7520)
* Progress in encoder decoder models: support for serving encoder/decoder models (#7258), and architecture for cross-attention (#4942)

### Hardware Support
* AMD: Add fp8 Linear Layer for rocm (#7210)
* Enhancements to TPU support: load time W8A16 quantization (#7005), optimized rope (#7635), and support multi-host inference (#7457).
* Intel: various refactoring for worker, executor, and model runner (#7686, #7712)

### Others
* Optimize prefix caching performance (#7193)
* Speculative decoding
    * Use target model max length as default for draft model (#7706)
    * EAGLE Implementation with Top-1 proposer (#6830)
* Entrypoints
    * A new `chat` method in the `LLM` class (#5049)
    * Support embeddings in the run_batch API (#7132)
    * Support `prompt_logprobs` in Chat Completion (#7453)
* Quantizations
    * Expand MoE weight loading + Add Fused Marlin MoE Kernel (#7527)
    * Machete - Hopper Optimized Mixed Precision Linear Kernel  (#7174)
* `torch.compile`: register custom ops for kernels (#7591, #7594, #7536)

**Published:** 2024-08-05

## Highlights

### Model Support
* Enhanced pipeline parallelism support for DeepSeek v2 (#6519), Qwen (#6974), Qwen2 (#6924), and Nemotron (#6863)
* Enhanced vision language model support for InternVL2 (#6514, #7067), BLIP-2 (#5920), MiniCPM-V (#4087, #7122).
* Added H2O Danube3-4b (#6451)
* Added Nemotron models (Nemotron-3, Nemotron-4, Minitron) (#6611)

### Hardware Support
* TPU enhancements: collective communication, TP for async engine, faster compile time (#6891, #6933, #6856, #6813, #5871)
* Intel CPU: enable multiprocessing and tensor parallelism (#6125)

### Performance
We are progressing along our quest to quickly improve performance. Each of the following PRs contributed some improvements, and we anticipate more enhancements in the next release. 

* Separated OpenAI Server's HTTP request handling and model inference loop with `zeromq`. This brought 20% speedup over time to first token and 2x speedup over inter token latency. (#6883)
* Used Python's native array data structure speedup padding. This bring 15% throughput enhancement in large batch size scenarios. (#6779)
* Reduce unnecessary compute when logprobs=None. This reduced latency of get log probs from ~30ms to ~5ms in large batch size scenarios. (#6532)
* Optimize `get_seqs` function, bring 2% throughput enhancements. (#7051)

### Production Features
* Enhancements to speculative decoding: FlashInfer in DraftModelRunner (#6926), observability (#6963), and benchmarks (#6964)
* Refactor the punica kernel based on Triton (#5036)
* Support for guided decoding for offline LLM (#6878)

### Quantization
* Support W4A8 quantization for vllm (#5218)
* Tuned FP8 and INT8 Kernels for Ada Lovelace and SM75 T4 (#6677, #6996, #6848)
* Support reading bitsandbytes pre-quantized model (#5753)

## v0.5.3: v0.5.3
**Published:** 2024-07-23

## Highlights

### Model Support
* vLLM now supports Meta Llama 3.1! Please checkout our blog [here](https://blog.vllm.ai/2024/07/23/llama31.html) for initial details on running the model. 
	* Please checkout [this thread](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/6689) for any known issues related to the model. 
	* The model runs on a single 8xH100 or 8xA100 node using FP8 quantization (#6606, #6547, #6487, #6593, #6511, #6515, #6552)
	* The BF16 version of the model should run on multiple nodes using pipeline parallelism ([docs](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/distributed_serving.html)). If you have fast network interconnect, you might want to consider full tensor paralellism as well. (#6599, #6598, #6529, #6569)
	* In order to support long context, a new rope extension method has been added and chunked prefill has been turned on by default for Meta Llama 3.1 series of model. (#6666, #6553, #6673)
* Support Mistral-Nemo (#6548)
* Support Chameleon (#6633, #5770)
* Pipeline parallel support for Mixtral (#6516)

### Hardware Support
* Many enhancements to TPU support. (#6277, #6457, #6506, #6504)

### Performance Enhancements
* Add AWQ support to the Marlin kernel. This brings significant (1.5-2x) perf improvements to existing AWQ models! (#6612)
* Progress towards refactoring for SPMD worker execution. (#6032)
* Progress in improving prepare inputs procedure. (#6164, #6338, #6596)
* Memory optimization for pipeline parallelism. (#6455)


### Production Engine
* Correctness testing for pipeline parallel and CPU offloading (#6410, #6549)
* Support dynamically loading Lora adapter from HuggingFace (#6234)
* Pipeline Parallel using stdlib multiprocessing module (#6130)


### Others
* A CPU offloading implementation, you can now use `--cpu-offload-gb` to control how much memory to "extend" the RAM with. (#6496)
* The new `vllm` CLI is now ready for testing. It comes with three commands: `serve`, `complete`, and `chat`. Feedback and improvements are greatly welcomed! (#6431)
* The wheels now build on Ubuntu 20.04 instead of 22.04. (#6517)

---

## v0.5.1: v0.5.1
**Published:** 2024-07-05

## Highlights
* vLLM now has pipeline parallelism! (#4412, #5408, #6115, #6120). You can now run the API server with `--pipeline-parallel-size`. This feature is in early stage, please let us know your feedback. 


### Model Support
* Support Gemma 2 (#5908, #6051). Please note that for correctness, Gemma should run with FlashInfer backend which supports logits soft cap. The wheels for FlashInfer can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/flashinfer-ai/flashinfer/releases/tag/v0.0.8)
* Support Jamba (#4115). This is vLLM's first state space model! 
* Support Deepseek-V2 (#4650). Please note that MLA (Multi-head Latent Attention) is not implemented and we are looking for contribution!
* Vision Language Model adding support for Phi3-Vision, dynamic image size, and a registry for processing model inputs (#4986, #5276, #5214)
  * Notably, it has a **breaking change** that all VLM specific arguments are now removed from engine APIs so you no longer need to set it globally via CLI. However, you now only need to pass in `<image>` into the prompt instead of complicated prompt formatting. See more [here](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/vlm.html#offline-batched-inference)
  * There is also a new [guide](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/enabling_multimodal_inputs.html) on adding VLMs! We would love your contribution for new models! 

### Hardware Support
* Enhancement to TPU support (#5292, #5878, #5850, #5831, #5855)
* OpenVINO backend (#5379)


### Production Service
* Support for sharded tensorized models (#4990)
* Continous streaming of OpenAI response token stats (#5742)


### Performance
* Enhancement in distributed communication via shared memory (#5399)
* Latency enhancement in block manager (#5584)
* Enhancements to `compressed-tensors` supporting Marlin, W4A16 (#5435, #5385)
* Faster FP8 quantize kernel (#5396), FP8 on Ampere (#5975)
* Option to use FlashInfer for prefill, decode, and CUDA Graph for decode (#4628)
* Speculative Decoding
	* MLPSpeculator (#4947, #6050)
	* Typical Acceptance Sampler (#5131, #5348)
* Draft Model Runner (#5799)


### Development Productivity
* Post merge benchmark is now available at perf.vllm.ai! 
* Addition of A100 in CI environment (#5658)
* Step towards nightly wheel publication (#5610)
