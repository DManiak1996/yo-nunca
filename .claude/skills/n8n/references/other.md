- Theme logos
- Text localization
  - Window title

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

White labelling n8n means customizing the frontend styling and assets to match your brand identity. The process involves changing two packages in n8n's source code [github.com/n8n-io/n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n):

- [packages/frontend/@n8n/design-system](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/frontend/@n8n/design-system): n8n's [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) design system with CSS styles and Vue.js components
- [packages/frontend/editor-ui](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/frontend/editor-ui): n8n's [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) frontend build with [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev)

You need the following installed on your development machine:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).

Create a fork of [n8n's repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) and clone your new repository.

Install all dependencies, build and start n8n.

Whenever you make changes you need to rebuild and restart n8n. While developing you can use `npm run dev` to automatically rebuild and restart n8n anytime you make code changes.

To customize theme colors open [packages/frontend/@n8n/design-system](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/frontend/@n8n/design-system) and start with:

- [packages/frontend/@n8n/design-system/src/css/\_tokens.scss](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/@n8n/design-system/src/css/_tokens.scss)
- [packages/frontend/@n8n/design-system/src/css/\_tokens.dark.scss](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/@n8n/design-system/src/css/_tokens.dark.scss)

At the top of `_tokens.scss` you will find `--color-primary` variables as HSL colors:

In the following example the primary color changes to #0099ff. To convert to HSL you can use a [color converter tool](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp).

To change the editor’s logo assets look into [packages/frontend/editor-ui/public](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/frontend/editor-ui/public) and replace:

- favicon-16x16.png
- favicon-32x32.png
- favicon.ico
- n8n-logo.svg
- n8n-logo-collapsed.svg
- n8n-logo-expanded.svg

Replace these logo assets. n8n uses them in Vue.js components, including:

- [MainSidebar.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/components/MainSidebar.vue): top/left logo in the main sidebar.
- [Logo.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/components/Logo/Logo.vue): reused in other components.

In the following example replace `n8n-logo-collapsed.svg` and `n8n-logo-expanded.svg` to update the main sidebar's logo assets.

If your logo assets require different sizing or placement you can customize SCSS styles at the bottom of [MainSidebar.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/components/MainSidebar.vue).

To change all text occurrences like `n8n` or `n8n.io` to your brand identity you can customize n8n's English internationalization file: [packages/frontend/@n8n/i18n/src/locales/en.json](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/@n8n/i18n/src/locales/en.json).

n8n uses the [Vue I18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/) internationalization plugin for Vue.js to translate the majority of UI texts. To search and replace text occurrences inside `en.json` you can use [Linked locale messages](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/guide/messages.html#linked-locale-messages).

In the following example add the `_brand.name` translation key to white label n8n's [AboutModal.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/components/AboutModal.vue).

To change n8n's window title to your brand name, edit the following:

- [packages/frontend/editor-ui/index.html](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/editor-ui/index.html)
- [packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/composables/useDocumentTitle.ts](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/frontend/editor-ui/src/composables/useDocumentTitle.ts)

The following example replaces all occurrences of `n8n` and `n8n.io` with `My Brand` in `index.html` and `useDocumentTitle.ts`.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/n8n.git n8n
cd n8n
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
@mixin theme {
	--color-primary-h: 6.9;
	--color-primary-s: 100%;
	--color-primary-l: 67.6%;
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
@mixin theme {
	--color-primary-h: 204;
	--color-primary-s: 100%;
	--color-primary-l: 50%;
```

## RBAC role types

**URL:** llms-txt#rbac-role-types

**Contents:**
- Project Admin
- Project Editor
- Project Viewer

- The Project Editor role is available on Pro Cloud and Self-hosted Enterprise plans.
- The Project Viewer role is only available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Cloud Enterprise plans.

Within projects, there are three user roles: Admin, Editor, and Viewer. These roles control what the user can do in a project. A user can have different roles within different projects.

A Project Admin role has the highest level of permissions. Project admins can:

- Manage project settings: Change name, delete project.
- Manage project members: Invite members and remove members, change members' roles.
- View, create, update, and delete any workflows, credentials, or executions within a project.

A Project Editor can view, create, update, and delete any workflows, credentials, or executions within a project.

A Project Viewer is effectively a `read-only` role with access to all workflows, credentials, and executions within a project.

Viewers aren't able to manually execute any workflows that exist in a project.

Role types and account types

Role types and [account types](../../account-types/) are different things. Every account has one type. The account can have different role types for different [projects](../projects/).

| Permission                      | Admin | Editor | Viewer |
| ------------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| View workflows in the project   |       |        |        |
| View credentials in the project |       |        |        |
| View executions                 |       |        |        |
| Edit credentials and workflows  |       |        |        |
| Add workflows and credentials   |       |        |        |
| Execute workflows               |       |        |        |
| Manage members                  |       |        |        |
| Modify the project              |       |        |        |

[Variables](../../../code/variables/) and [tags](../../../workflows/tags/) aren't affected by RBAC: they're global across the n8n instance.

## Use AI in the Code node

AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.

AI generated code overwrites your code

If you've already written some code on the **Code** tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.

To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:

1. In the Code node, set **Language** to **JavaScript**.
1. Select the **Ask AI** tab.
1. Write your query.
1. Select **Generate Code**. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the **Code** tab.

During the trial phase there are no usage limits. If n8n makes the feature permanent, there may be usage limits as part of your pricing tier.

The ChatGPT implementation in n8n has the following limitations:

- The AI writes code that manipulates data from the n8n workflow. You can't ask it to pull in data from other sources.
- The AI doesn't know your data, just the schema, so you need to tell it things like how to find the data you want to extract, or how to check for null.
- Nodes before the Code node must execute and deliver data to the Code node before you run your AI query.
- Doesn't work with large incoming data schemas.
- May have issues if there are a lot of nodes before the code node.

## Writing good prompts

Writing good prompts increases the chance of getting useful code back.

- Provide examples: if possible, give a sample expected output. This helps the AI to better understand the transformation or logic you’re aiming for.
- Describe the processing steps: if there are specific processing steps or logic that should apply to the data, list them in sequence. For example: "First, filter out all users under 18. Then, sort the remaining users by their last name."
- Avoid ambiguities: while the AI understands various instructions, being clear and direct ensures you get the most accurate code. Instead of saying "Get the older users," you might say "Filter users who are 60 years and above."
- Be clear about what you expect as the output. Do you want the data transformed, filtered, aggregated, or sorted? Provide as much detail as possible.

And some n8n-specific guidance:

- Think about the input data: make sure ChatGPT knows which pieces of the data you want to access, and what the incoming data represents. You may need to tell ChatGPT about the availability of n8n's built-in methods and variables.
- Declare interactions between nodes: if your logic involves data from multiple nodes, specify how they should interact. "Merge the output of 'Node A' with 'Node B' based on the 'userID' property". if you prefer data to come from certain nodes or to ignore others, be clear: "Only consider data from the 'Purchases' node and ignore the 'Refunds' node."
- Ensure the output is compatible with n8n. Refer to [Data structure](../../data/data-structure/) for more information on the data structure n8n requires.

These examples show a range of possible prompts and tasks.

#### Example 1: Find a piece of data inside a second dataset

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](../../_workflows/ai-code/find-a-piece-of-data.json) and import it into n8n.

In the third Code node, enter this prompt:

> The slack data contains only one item. The input data represents all Notion users. Sometimes the person property that holds the email can be null. I want to find the notionId of the Slack user and return it.

Take a look at the code the AI generates.

This is the JavaScript you need:

#### Example 2: Data transformation

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](../../_workflows/ai-code/data-transformation.json) and import it into n8n.

In the **Join items** Code node, enter this prompt:

> Return a single line of text that has all usernames listed with a comma. Each username should be enquoted with a double quotation mark.

Take a look at the code the AI generates.

This is the JavaScript you need:

#### Example 3: Summarize data and create a Slack message

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](../../_workflows/ai-code/summarize-data.json) and import it into n8n.

In the **Summarize** Code node, enter this prompt:

> Create a markdown text for Slack that counts how many ideas, features and bugs have been submitted. The type of submission is saved in the property_type field. A feature has the property "Feature", a bug has the property "Bug" and an idea has the property "Bug". Also, list the five top submissions by vote in that message. Use "" as markdown for links.

Take a look at the code the AI generates.

This is the JavaScript you need:

### Reference incoming node data explicitly

If your incoming data contains nested fields, using dot notation to reference them can help the AI understand what data you want.

To try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](../../_workflows/ai-code/reference-incoming-data-explicitly.json) and import it into n8n.

In the second Code node, enter this prompt:

> The data in "Mock data" represents a list of people. For each person, return a new item containing personal_info.first_name and work_info.job_title.

This is the JavaScript you need:

### Related resources

Pluralsight offer a short guide on [How to use ChatGPT to write code](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/how-use-chatgpt-programming-coding), which includes example prompts.

The AI-generated code may work without any changes, but you may have to edit it. You need to be aware of n8n's [Data structure](../../data/data-structure/). You may also find n8n's built-in methods and variables useful.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
const slackUser = $("Mock Slack").all()[0];
const notionUsers = $input.all();
const slackUserEmail = slackUser.json.email;

const notionUser = notionUsers.find(
  (user) => user.json.person && user.json.person.email === slackUserEmail
);

return notionUser ? [{ json: { notionId: notionUser.json.id } }] : [];
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
const items = $input.all();
const usernames = items.map((item) => `"${item.json.username}"`);
const result = usernames.join(", ");
return [{ json: { usernames: result } }];
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
const submissions = $input.all();

// Count the number of ideas, features, and bugs
let ideaCount = 0;
let featureCount = 0;
let bugCount = 0;

submissions.forEach((submission) => {
  switch (submission.json.property_type[0]) {
    case "Idea":
      ideaCount++;
      break;
    case "Feature":
      featureCount++;
      break;
    case "Bug":
      bugCount++;
      break;
  }
});

// Sort submissions by votes and take the top 5
const topSubmissions = submissions
  .sort((a, b) => b.json.property_votes - a.json.property_votes)
  .slice(0, 5);

let topSubmissionText = "";
topSubmissions.forEach((submission) => {
  topSubmissionText += `<${submission.json.url}|${submission.json.name}> with ${submission.json.property_votes} votes\n`;
});

// Construct the Slack message
const slackMessage = `*Summary of Submissions*\n
Ideas: ${ideaCount}\n
Features: ${featureCount}\n
Bugs: ${bugCount}\n
Top 5 Submissions:\n
${topSubmissionText}`;

return [{ json: { slackMessage } }];
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
const items = $input.all();
const newItems = items.map((item) => {
  const firstName = item.json.personal_info.first_name;
  const jobTitle = item.json.work_info.job_title;
  return {
    json: {
      firstName,
      jobTitle,
    },
  };
});
return newItems;

| `N8N_INVITE_LINKS_EMAIL_ONLY`                   | Boolean | `false` | When set to true, n8n will only deliver invite links via email and will not expose them through the API. This option enhances security by preventing invite URLs from being accessible programmatically, or to high priviledged users.                               |

You can also view the [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) in the GitHub repository.

Latest and Next versions

n8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

Current `latest`: 1.118.1\
Current `next`: 1.119.0

The steps to update your n8n depend on which n8n platform you use. Refer to the documentation for your n8n:

- [Cloud](../manage-cloud/update-cloud-version/)
- Self-hosted options:
  - [npm](../hosting/installation/npm/)
  - [Docker](../hosting/installation/docker/)

## Semantic versioning in n8n

n8n uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). All version numbers are in the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Version numbers increment as follows:

- MAJOR version when making incompatible changes which can require user action.
- MINOR version when adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
- PATCH version when making backward-compatible bug fixes.

You can find the release notes for older versions of n8n [here](0-x/)

**Release date:** 2025-11-03

This is the `next` version. n8n recommends using the `latest` version. The `next` version may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).

This release includes multiple bug fixes for AI Agent, task runners, editor, and integrations, as well as new features like improved workflow settings, AWS Assume Role credentials, and enhanced security and audit capabilities.

The Guardrails node provides a set of rules and policies that control an AI agent's behavior by filtering its inputs and outputs. This helps safeguard from malicious input and from generating unsafe or undesirable responses. There are two operations:

- Check Text for Violations: Validate text against a set of policies (e.g. NSFW, prompt injection).
- Sanitize Text: Detects and replaces specific data such as PII, URLs, or secrets with placeholders.

The default presets and prompts are adapted from the open-source [guardrails package](https://github.com/openai/openai-guardrails-js) made available by OpenAI.

For more info, see [Guardrails documentation](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.guardrails/)

### AI Workflow Builder is now available to Enterprise Cloud users.

AI Workflow Builder turns prompts into workflows. Describe what you want to build, and n8n will generate a draft workflow by adding, configuring, and connecting nodes for you. From there, you can refine and expand the workflow directly in the editor.

- Previously available to Starter and Pro users, AI Workflow Builder is now accessible to Enterprise Cloud users as well, with 1,000 monthly credits.
- Supported on n8n version 1.115+. **If you don’t see the feature yet, open /settings/usage to trigger a license refresh.**
- We’ve fixed a bug and now cloud users on v1.117.1 onwards will have access to a more reliable builder.
- We’re currently working on bringing AI Workflow Builder to self-hosted users as well, including Community, Business, and Enterprise.

### Data migration tool

You can now easily migrate n8n data between different database types. This new tooling currently supports SQLite and Postgres, making the transition to a scaling database choice simpler, allowing you to take your data with you.

The tooling comes in the form of two new CLI commands, `export:entities` and `import:entities`

**`Export`** The new export command lets you export data from your existing n8n database (SQLite / Postgres), producing a set of encrypted files within a compressed directory for you to move around and use with the import commands.

For details, see [Export entities](../hosting/cli-commands/#export-entities)

**`Import`** The new import command allows you to read from a compressed and encrypted set of files generated from the new export command, and import them in to your new database of choice (SQLite / Postgres) to be used with your n8n instance.

For details, see [Import entities](../hosting/cli-commands/#import-entities)

### AI Workflow Builder (Beta)

**AI Workflow Builder** turns your natural language prompts into working automations. Describe what you want to build, and n8n will generate a draft workflow by adding and configuring nodes and wiring up the logic for you. From there, you can refine, expand, or adjust the workflow directly in the editor.

This feature helps you move from idea to implementation faster and without losing technical control. It’s especially helpful when starting from a blank canvas, validating an approach, or exploring new nodes and capabilities. Multi-turn interaction lets you iterate in conversation, turning your ideas into structured, production-ready workflows step by step.

Learn more about how we we’re building this feature in our [forum post](https://community.n8n.io/t/ai-powered-workflow-building-coming-soon/196499).

[](/_video/release-notes/AI_Workflow_Builder.webm)

- This feature is initially going to be available for Cloud users on the 14-day Trial, Starter and Pro plans.
- Availability for Enterprise users on Cloud will follow in a future update.
- We are actively exploring the best way to bring this feature to self-hosted users.

- To ensure the smoothest experience for all users, this feature will be rolled out to users on version 1.115.0 over the course of a week so you may not have access to the feature immediately when you upgrade to 1.115.0.

**Credit limits by plan:** This feature will have monthly credit limits [by plan](https://n8n.io/pricing/).

- Each prompt/interaction with the AI Workflow Builder consumes one credit.
- Trial users have access to 20 credits, Starter plans have 50 per month and Pro plans will have 150 credits per month.
- At this time, there will not be a way to access additional credits within your plan, however we are we are exploring this.

Learn more about AI Workflow Builder in [documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/ai-workflow-builder/).

### Source Control: Added HTTPS support

You can now connect to Git repositories via HTTPS in addition to SSH, making Source Control usable in environments where SSH is restricted.

### Python task runner

This version introduces the **Python task runner** as a beta feature. This feature secures n8n's Python sandbox and enables users to run real Python modules in n8n workflows. The original Pyodide-based implementation will be phased out.

This is a **breaking change** that replaces Pyodide - see [here](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/#python-native-beta) for a list of differences. Any Code node set to the legacy `python` parameter will need to be manually updated to use the new `pythonNative` parameter. Any Code node script set to `python` and relying on Pyodide syntax is likely to need to be manually adjusted to account for breaking changes.

- For self-hosting users, see [here](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/task-runners/#setting-up-external-mode) for deployment instructions for task runners going forward and how to install extra dependencies.
- On n8n Cloud, this will be a gradual transition. If in your n8n Cloud instance the Code node offers an option named "Python (Native) (Beta)", then your instance has been transitioned to native Python and you will need to look out for any breaking changes. Imports are disabled for security reasons at this time.

The native Python runner is currently in beta and is subject to change as we find a balance between security and usability. Your feedback is welcome.

This release contains bug fixes.

We’re excited to introduce **data tables**, bringing built-in data storage to n8n. You can now store and query structured data directly inside the platform, without relying on external databases for many common automation scenarios. Track workflow state between runs, store tokens or session data, keep product or customer reference tables, or stage intermediate results for multi-step processes.

Previously, persisting data meant provisioning and connecting to an external store such as Redis or Google Sheets. That added credential setup, infrastructure overhead, latency, and constant context switching. **Data tables** eliminate that friction and keeps your data easily editable and close to your workflows.

Data tables are available today on all plans. They currently support numbers, strings, and datetimes with JSON support coming soon. On Cloud, each instance can store up to 50 MB. On self-hosted setups, the default is also 50 MB, but this limit can be adjusted if your infrastructure allows.

[Overview of data tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkiIkt6lZ4)

**Create a data table**

- From the canvas, open the **Create workflow** dropdown and select **Create Data table**.
- Or, go to the **Overview** panel on the left-side navigation bar and open the **Data tables** tab.

**Use a data table in your workflow**

- Add the **Data table node** to your workflow to get, update, insert, upsert, or delete rows.

**Adjust the storage limit** (self-hosted only)

- Change the default 50 MB limit with the environment variable: `N8N_DATA_TABLES_MAX_SIZE_BYTES`. [See configuration docs](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/).

- Data tables don’t currently support foreign keys or default values.
- For now, all data tables are accessible to everyone in a project. More granular permissions and sharing options are planned.

Learn more about [**data tables**](../data/data-tables/) and the [**Data table node**](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datatable/).

This release contains core updates, editor improvements, a new node, node updates, and bug fixes.

We’ve made updates to strengthen Single Sign-On (SSO) reliability and security, especially for enterprise and multi-instance setups.

- OIDC and SAML sync in multi-main setups \[version: 1.113.0\]: In multi-main deployments, updates to SSO settings are now synchronized across all instances, ensuring consistent login behavior everywhere.
- Enhanced OIDC integration \[version 1.111.0\]: n8n now supports OIDC providers that enforce state and nonce parameters. These are validated during login, providing smoother and more secure Single Sign-On.

### Filter insights by project

We've added project filtering to insights, enabling more granular reporting and visibility into individual project performance.

- Execution details: `GET /executions` now includes *status* and *workflow_name* in the response.
- Retry execution endpoint: Added new public API endpoints to retry failed executions.
- Additional filters: You can now filter executions by running or canceled status.

### Enhancements to workflow diff

We added a several updates on workflows diffs as well:

- Better view in Code nodes and Stickies: Workflow diffs now highlight changes per line instead of per block, making edits easier to review and understand.
- Enable/Disable sync: You can now enable or disable sync in the viewport, letting you compare a workflow change in one view without affecting the other.

For teams working across different environments, deployments often involve multiple people making changes at different times. Without a clear view of those changes, it’s easy to miss something important.

[Workflow Diff](../source-control-environments/using/compare-changes/) gives you an easy and visual way to review workflow changes before you deploy them between environments.

- Quickly see what’s been added, changed, or deleted, with clear colour highlights.
- Easily see important settings changes on a workflow.
- Check changes inside each node, and spot connector updates, with a side-by-side view of its settings.
- Get a quick count of all changes to understand the size of a deployment.

Workflow Diff eases the review and approval of changes before deployment, enabling teams to collaborate on workflows without breaking existing automations or disrupting production. It’s one step further in integrating DevOps best practices in n8n.

Now available for Enterprise customers using Environments.

### **No more limit of active workflows and new self-hosted Business Plan**

We have rolled out a new pricing model to make it easier for builders of all sizes to adopt and scale automation with n8n.

**No more limit of active workflows.**

All n8n plans, from Starter to Enterprise, now include unlimited users, workflows, and steps. Our pricing is based on the volume of executions. Meaning you can build and test as many workflows as you want, including complex, data-heavy, or long-running automations, without worrying about quotas.

**New self-hosted Business Plan for growing teams**

Designed for SMBs and mid-sized companies, the Business Plan includes features such as:

- 6 shared projects
- SSO, SAML and LDAP
- Different environments
- Global variables
- Version control using Git
- 30 days of Insights

Please note that this plan only includes support from our community forum. For dedicated support we recommend upgrading to our Enterprise plan.

**Enterprise pricing now scales with executions**

Enterprise plans no longer use workflow-based pricing, and is now also based on the volume of executions.

***What you need to do***

To ensure these changes apply to your account, update your n8n instance to the latest version.

[Read the blog](https://blog.n8n.io/build-without-limits-everything-you-need-to-know-about-n8ns-new-pricing/) for full details.

### **Respond to Chat node**

With the [\*\*Respond to Chat](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.respondtochat/) node\*\*, you can now access Human-in-the-Loop functionality natively in n8n Chat.

Enable conversational experiences where you can ask for clarification, request approval before taking further action, and get back intermediate results — all within a single workflow execution.

This unlocks multi-turn interactions that feel more natural and reduce the number of executions required. It is ideal for building interactive AI use cases like conversational forms, branched workflows based on user replies, and step-by-step approvals.

- Add a **Chat Trigger** node and select **Using Respond Nodes** for the **Response mode**
- Place the **Respond to Chat** node anywhere in your workflow to send a message into the Chat and optionally wait for the user to input a response before continuing execution of the workflow steps.

### **Chat streaming**

No more waiting for full responses to load when using the n8n chat interface. **Streaming** now delivers AI-generated text replies word by word so users can read messages as they’re being generated. It feels faster, smoother, and more like what people expect from chat experiences.

Streaming is available in public chat views (hosted or embedded) and can be used in custom apps via webhook.

Configure streaming in the Node Details View of these nodes:

- Chat Trigger node: Options>Add Field>Response Mode>Streaming
- Webhook node: Respond>Streaming
- AI Agent node: Add option> Enable streaming

[](/_video/release-notes/streaming.webm)

### Improved instance user list with more visibility

The instance user list has been updated with a new table layout and additional details to help admins manage access more easily.

- See total users and filter by name or email
- View which projects each user has access to
- Whether a user has enabled 2FA and sort based on that
- See the last active date for each user

This makes it easier to audit user activity, identify inactive accounts, and understand how access is distributed across your instance.

### Webhook HTML responses

Starting with this release, if your workflow sends an HTML response to a webhook, n8n automatically wraps the content in an `<iframe>`. This is a security mechanism to protect the instance users.

This has the following implications:

- HTML renders in a sandboxed iframe instead of directly in the parent document.
- JavaScript code that attempts to access the top-level window or local storage will fail.
- Authentication headers aren't available in the sandboxed iframe (for example, basic auth). You need to use an alternative approach, like embedding a short-lived access token within the HTML.
- Relative URLs (for example, `<form action="/">`) won't work. Use absolute URLs instead.

### Built-in Metrics for AI Evaluations

Using evaluations is a best practice for any AI solution, and a must if reliability and predictability are business-critical. With this release, we’ve made it easier to set up evaluations in n8n by introducing a set of built-in metrics. These metrics can review AI responses and assign scores based on factors like correctness, helpfulness, and more.

You can run regular evaluations and review scores over time as a way to monitor your AI workflow's performance. You can also compare results across different models to help guide model selection, or run evaluations before and after a prompt change to support data-driven, iterative building.

As with all evaluations in n8n, you’ll need a dataset that includes the inputs you want to test. For some evaluations, the dataset must also include expected outputs (ground truth) to compare against. The evaluation workflow runs each input through the portion you're testing to generate a response. The built-in metric scores each response based on the aspect you're measuring, allowing you to compare results before and after changes or track trends over time in the Evaluations tab.

You can still define your own custom metrics, but for common use cases, the built-in options make it much faster to implement.

1. Set up your evaluation as described [here](../advanced-ai/evaluations/metric-based-evaluations/#how-it-works), using an **Evaluation** node as the trigger and another with the **Set Metrics** operation.
1. In the **Set Metrics** node, choose a metric from the dropdown list.
1. Define any additional parameters required for your selected metric. In most cases, this includes mapping the dataset columns to the appropriate fields.

📏 **Available built-in metrics:**

- **Correctness (AI-based):** Compares AI workflow-generated responses to expected answers. Another LLM acts as a judge, scoring the responses based on guidance you provide in the prompt.
- **Helpfulness (AI-based):** Evaluates how helpful a response is in relation to a user query, using an LLM and prompt-defined scoring criteria.
- **String Similarity:** Measures how closely the response matches the expected output by comparing strings. Useful for command generation or when output needs to follow a specific structure.
- **Categorization:** Checks whether a response matches an expected label, such as assigning items to the correct category.
- **Tools Used:** Verifies whether the AI agent called the tools you specified in your dataset. To enable this, make sure **Return Intermediate Steps** is turned on in your agent so the evaluation can access the tools it actually called.

- Registered Community Edition enables analysis of one evaluation in the **Evaluations** tab which allows easy comparison of evaluation runs over time. Pro and Enterprise plans allow unlimited evaluations in the **Evaluations** tab.

[Learn more](../advanced-ai/evaluations/overview/) about setting up and customizing evaluations.

### AI Agent Tool node

With the **AI Agent Tool** node we are introducing a simplified pattern for multi-agent orchestration that can be run in a single execution and stay entirely on one canvas. You can now connect multiple **AI Agent Tool** nodes to a primary **AI Agent** node, allowing it to supervise and delegate work across other specialized agents.

This setup is especially useful for building complex systems that function like real-world teams, where a lead agent assigns parts of a task to specialists. You can even add multiple layers of agents directing other agents, just like you would have in a real multi-tiered organizational structure. It also helps with prompt management by letting you split long, complex instructions into smaller, focused tasks across multiple agents. While similar orchestration was already possible using sub-workflows, AI Agent Tool nodes are a good choice when you want the interaction to happen within a single execution or prefer to manage and debug everything from a single canvas.

- Add an **AI Agent** node to your workflow and click **+** to create a Tools connection.
- Search for and select the **AI Agent Tool** node from the Nodes Panel.
- Name the node clearly so the primary agent can reference it, then add a short description and prompt.
- Connect any LLMs, memory, and tools the agent needs to perform its role.
- Instruct the primary **AI Agent** on when to use the **AI Agent Tool** and to pass along relevant context in its prompt.

- The orchestrating agent does not pass full execution context by default. Any necessary context must be included in the prompt.

**AI Agent Tool** nodes makes it easier to build layered, agent-to-agent workflows without relying on sub-workflows, helping you move faster when building and debugging multi-agent systems.

### Enforce 2FA across your instance

Enterprise Instance owners can now enforce two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users in their instance.

Once enabled, any user who hasn’t set up 2FA will be redirected to complete the setup before they can continue using n8n. This helps organizations meet internal security policies and ensures stronger protection across the workspace.

This feature is available only on the Enterprise plan.

This release contains core updates, editor improvements, a new node, node updates, and bug fixes.

### Model Selector node

The [Model Selector node](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.modelselector/) gives you more control when working with multiple LLMs in your workflows.

Use it to determine which connected model should handle a given input, based on conditions like expressions or global variables. This makes it easier to implement model routing strategies, such as switching models based on performance, task type, cost, or availability.

🛠️ **How to:** Connect multiple model nodes to the Model Selector node, then configure routing conditions in the node’s settings.

- Rules are evaluated in order. The first matching rule determines which model is used even if others would also match.
- As a sub-node, expressions behave differently here: they always resolves to the first item rather than resolving for each item in turn.

The Model Selector node is especially useful in evaluation or production scenarios where routing logic between models needs to adapt based on performance, cost, availability, or dataset-specific needs.

### Support for OIDC (OpenID Connect) authentication

You can now use OIDC (OpenID Connect) as an authentication method for Single Sign-On (SSO).

This gives enterprise teams more flexibility to integrate n8n with their existing identity providers using a widely adopted and easy-to-manage standard. OIDC is now available alongside SAML, giving Enterprises the choice to select what best fits their internal needs.

### Project admins can now commit to Git within environments

Project admins now have the ability to commit workflow and credential changes directly to Git through the environments feature. This update streamlines the workflow deployment process by giving project-level admins direct control over committing their changes. It also ensures that the those who know their workflows best can review and commit updates themselves, without needing to involve instance-level admins.

### Automatically name nodes

This adds clarity to your canvas and saves time renaming nodes manually.

Don’t worry, automatic naming won’t break references. And, and if you’ve renamed a node yourself, we’ll leave it just the way you wrote it.

[](/_video/release-notes/automatic_node_naming.mp4)

### Support for RAG extended with built-in templates

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can improve AI responses by providing language models access to data sources with up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge. RAG workflows typically rely on vector stores to manage and search this data efficiently.

To get the benefits of using vector stores, such as returning results based on semantic meaning rather than just keyword matches, you need a way to upload your data to the vector store and a way to query it.

In n8n, uploading and querying vectors stores happens in two workflows. Now, you have an example to get your started and make implementation easier with the **RAG starter template**.

- The **Load Data** workflow shows how to add data with the appropriate embedding model, split it into chunks with the [Default Data Loader](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/), and add metadata as desired.
- The **Retriever** workflow for querying data, shows how agents and vector stores work together to help you define highly relevant results and save tokens using the **Question and Answer** tool.

Enable semantic search and the retrieval of unstructured data for increased quality and relevance of AI responses.

- Search for **RAG starter template** in the search bar of the Nodes panel to insert it into your workflow.

### Convert to sub-workflow

Large, monolithic workflows can slow things down. They’re harder to maintain, tougher to debug, and more difficult to scale. With sub-workflows, you can take a more modular approach, breaking up big workflows into smaller, manageable parts that are easier to reuse, test, understand, and explain.

Until now, creating sub-workflows required copying and pasting nodes manually, setting up a new workflow from scratch, and reconnecting everything by hand. **Convert to sub-workflow** allows you to simplify this process into a single action, so you can spend more time building and less time restructuring.

[](/_video/release-notes/convert_to_sub-workflow.mp4)

1. Highlight the nodes you want to convert to a sub-workflow. These must:
   - Be fully connected, meaning no missing steps in between them
   - Start from a single starting node
   - End with a single node
1. Right-click to open the context menu and select **Convert to sub-workflow**
   - Or use the shortcut: `Alt + X`
1. n8n will:
   - Open a new tab containing the selected nodes
   - Preserve all node parameters as-is
   - Replace the selected nodes in the original workflow with a **Call My Sub-workflow** node

*Note*: You will need to manually adjust the field types in the Start and Return nodes in the new sub-workflow.

This makes it easier to keep workflows modular, performant, and easier to maintain.

### API support for assigning users to projects

You can now use the API to add and update users within projects. This includes:

- Assigning existing or pending users to a project with a specific role
- Updating a user’s role within a project
- Removing users from one or more projects

This update now allows you to use the API to add users to both the instance and specific projects, removing the need to manually assign them in the UI.

### Add pending users to project member assignment

You can now add **pending users,** those who have been invited but haven't completed sign-up, to projects as members.

This change lets you configure a user's project access upfront, without waiting for them to finish setting up their account. It eliminates the back-and-forth of managing access post-sign-up, ensuring users have the right project roles immediately upon joining.

### Evaluations for AI workflows

We’ve added a feature to help you iterate, test, and compare changes to your AI automations before pushing them to production so you can achieve more predictability and make better decisions.

When you're building with AI, a small prompt tweak or model swap might improve results with some inputs, while quietly degrading performance with others. But without a way to evaluate performance across many inputs, you’re left guessing whether your AI is actually getting better when you make a change.

By implementing **Evaluations for AI workflows** in n8n, you can assess how your AI performs across a range of inputs by adding a dedicated path in your workflow for running test cases and applying custom metrics to track results. This helps you build viable proof-of-concepts quickly, iterate more effectively, catch regressions early, and make more confident decisions when your AI is in production.

#### Evaluation node and tab

The **Evaluation node** includes several operations that, when used together, enable end-to-end AI evaluation.

- Run your AI logic against a wide range of test cases in the same execution
- Capture the outputs of those test cases
- Score the results using your own metrics or LLM-as-judge logic
- Isolate a testing path to only include the nodes and logic you want to evaluate

The **Evaluations tab** enables you to review test results in the n8n UI, perfect for comparing runs, spotting regressions, and viewing performance over time.

#### 🛠 How evaluations work

The evaluation path runs alongside your normal execution logic and only activates when you want—making it ideal for testing and iteration.

Get started by selecting an AI workflow you want to evaluate that includes one or more LLM or Agent nodes.

1. Add an **Evaluation** node with the **On new Evaluation event** operation. This node will act as an additional trigger you’ll run only when testing. Configure it to read your dataset from Google Sheets, with each row representing a test input.

> 💡 Better datasets mean better evaluations. Craft your dataset from a variety of test cases, including edge cases and typical inputs, to get meaningful feedback on how your AI performs. Learn more and access sample datasets [here](../advanced-ai/evaluations/light-evaluations/#1-create-a-dataset).

1. Add a second **Evaluation** node using the **Set Outputs** operation after the part of the workflow you're testing—typically after an LLM or Agent node. This captures the response and writes it back to your dataset in Google Sheets.

1. To evaluate output quality, add a third **Evaluation** node with the **Set Metrics** operation at a point after you’ve generated the outputs. You can develop workflow logic, custom calculations, or add an LLM-as-Judge to score the outputs. Map these metrics to your dataset in the node’s parameters.

> 💡 Well-defined metrics = smarter decisions. Scoring your outputs based on similarity, correctness, or categorization can help you track whether changes are actually improving performance. Learn more and get links to example templates [here](../advanced-ai/evaluations/metric-based-evaluations/#2-add-metrics-to-workflow).

When the Evaluation trigger node is executed, it runs each input in our dataset through your AI logic. This continues until all test cases are processed, a limit is reached, or you manually stop the execution. Once your evaluation path is set up, you can update your prompt, model, or workflow logic—and re-run the Evaluation trigger node to compare results. If you’ve added metrics, they’ll appear in the Evaluations tab.

In some instances, you may want to isolate your testing path to make iteration faster or to avoid executing downstream logic. In this case, you can add an Evaluation node with the `Check If Evaluating` operation to ensure only the expected nodes run when performing evaluations.

#### Things to keep in mind

Evaluations for AI Workflows are designed to fit into your development flow, with more enhancements on the way. For now, here are a few things to note:

- Test datasets are currently managed through Google Sheets. You’ll need a Google Sheets credential to run evaluations.
- Each workflow supports one evaluation at a time. If you’d like to test multiple segments, consider splitting them into sub-workflows for more flexibility.
- Community Edition supports one single evaluation. Pro and Enterprise plans allow unlimited evaluations.
- AI Evaluations are not enabled for instances in scaling mode at this time.

You can find details, tips, and common troubleshooting info [here](../advanced-ai/evaluations/tips-and-common-issues/).

**Release date:** 2025-05-19

This release contains editor improvements, an API update, node updates, new nodes, and bug fixes.

### Verified community nodes on Cloud

We’ve expanded the n8n ecosystem and unlocked a new level of flexibility for all users including those on n8n Cloud! Now you can access a select set of community nodes and partner integrations without leaving the canvas. This means you install and automate with a wider range of integrations without leaving your workspace. The power of the community is now built-in.

This update focuses on three major improvements:

- **Cloud availability**: Community nodes are no longer just for self-hosted users. A select set of nodes is now available on n8n Cloud.
- **Built-in discovery**: You can find and explore these nodes right from the Nodes panel without leaving the editor or searching on npm.
- **Trust and verification**: Nodes that appear in the editor have been manually vetted for quality and security. These verified nodes are marked with a checkmark.

We’re starting with a selection of around 25 nodes, including some of the most-used community-built packages and partner-supported integrations. For this phase, we focused on nodes that don’t include external package dependencies - helping streamline the review process and ensure a smooth rollout.

This is just the start. We plan to expand the library gradually, bringing even more verified nodes into the editor along with the powerful and creative use cases they unlock. In time, our criteria will evolve, opening the door to a wider range of contributions while keeping quality and security in focus.

Learn more about this update and find out which nodes are already installable from the editor in our [blog](https://blog.n8n.io/community-nodes-available-on-n8n-cloud/) post.

💻 **Use a verified node**

Make sure you're on **n8n version 1.94.0** or later and the instance Owner has enabled verified community nodes. On Cloud, this can be done from the Admin Panel. For self-hosted instances, please refer to [documentation](../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes/). In both cases, verified nodes are enabled by default.

- Open the **Nodes panel** from the editor
- Search for the Node. Verified nodes are indicated by a shield 🛡️
- Select the node and click **Install**

[](/_video/release-notes/Community-nodes-node-panel.mp4)

Once an Owner installs a node, everyone on the instance can start using it—just drag, drop, and connect like any other node in your workflow.

🛠️ **Build a node and get it verified**

Want your node to be verified and discoverable from the editor? Here’s how to get involved:

1. Review the [community node verification guidelines](../integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/verification-guidelines/).
1. If you’re building something new, follow the recommendations for [creating nodes](../integrations/creating-nodes/overview/).
1. Check your design against the [UX guidelines](../integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ux-guidelines/).
1. [Submit your node](../integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes/) to npm.
1. Request verification by filling out [this form](https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/form/f0ff9304-f34a-420e-99da-6103a2f8ac5b).

**Already built a node? Raise your hand!**

If you’ve already published a community node and want it considered for verification, make sure it meets the requirements noted above, then let us know by submitting the interest [form](https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/form/f0ff9304-f34a-420e-99da-6103a2f8ac5b). We’re actively curating the next batch and would love to include your work.

### Extended logs view

When workflows get complex, debugging can get... clicky. That’s where an extended **Logs View** comes in. Now you can get a clearer path to trace executions, troubleshoot issues, and understand the behavior of a complete workflow — without bouncing between node detail views.

This update brings a unified, always-accessible panel to the bottom of the canvas, showing you each step of the execution as it happens. Whether you're working with loops, sub-workflows, or AI agents, you’ll see a structured view of everything that ran, in the order it ran—with input, output, and status info right where you need it.

You can jump into node details when you want to dig deeper, or follow a single item through every step it touched. Real-time highlighting shows you which nodes are currently running or have failed, and you’ll see total execution time for any workflow—plus token usage for AI workflows to help monitor performance. And if you're debugging across multiple screens? Just pop the logs out and drag them wherever you’d like.

- Adds a **Logs view** to the bottom of the canvas that can be opened or collapsed. (Chat also appears here if your workflow uses it).
- Displays a **hierarchical list of nodes** in the order they were executed—including expanded views of sub-workflows.
- Allows you to **click a node in hierarchy** to preview inputs and outputs directly, or jump into the full Node Details view with a link.
- Provides ability to **toggle** input and output data on and off.
- Highlights each node **live as it runs**, showing when it starts, completes, or fails.
- Includes **execution history** view to explore past execution data in a similar way.
- Shows **roll-up stats** like total execution time and total AI tokens used (for AI-enabled workflows).
- Includes a **“pop out”** button to open the logs as a floating window—perfect for dragging to another screen while debugging.

To access the expanded logs view, click on the Logs bar at the bottom of the canvas. The view is also opens up when you open the chat window on the bottom of the page.

**Release date:** 2025-05-12

This release contains core updates, editor improvements, new nodes, node updates, and bug fixes.

### Faster ways to open sub-workflows

We’ve added several new ways to navigate your multi-workflow automations faster.

From any workflow with a sub-workflow node:

🖱️ Right-click on a sub-workflow node and select `Open sub-workflow` from the context menu

⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts

- **Windows:** `CTRL + SHIFT + O` or `CTRL + Double Click`
- **Mac:** `CMD + SHIFT + O` or `CMD + Double Click`

These options will bring your sub-workflow up in a new tab.

### Archive workflows

If you’ve ever accidentally removed a workflow, you’ll appreciate the new archiving feature. Instead of permanently deleting workflows with the Remove action, workflows are now archived by default. This allows you to recover them if needed.

- **Archive a workflow** - Select **Archive** from the Editor UI menu. It has replaced the **Remove** action.
- **Find archived workflows** - Archived workflows are hidden by default. To find your archived workflows, select the option for **Show archived workflows** in the workflow filter menu.
- **Permanently delete a workflow** - Once a workflow is archived, you can **Delete** it from the options menu.
- **Recover a workflow** - Select **Unarchive** from the options menu.

- Workflows archival requires the same permissions as required previously for removal.
- You cannot select archived workflows as sub-workflows to execute
- Active workflows are deactivated when they are archived
- Archived workflows can not be edited

This release contains core updates, editor improvements, node updates, and bug fixes.

### Partial Execution for AI Tools

We’ve made it easier to build and iterate on AI agents in n8n. You can now run and test specific tools without having to execute the entire agent workflow.

Partial execution is especially useful when refining or troubleshooting parts of your agent logic. It allows you to test changes incrementally, without triggering full agent runs, reducing unnecessary AI calls, token usage, and downstream activity. This makes iteration faster, more cost-efficient, and more precise when working with complex or multi-step AI workflows.

Partial execution for AI tools is available now for all tools - making it even easier to build, test, and fine-tune AI agents in n8n.

[](/_video/release-notes/AI-agent-partial-execution.mp4)

To use this feature you can either:

- Click the **Play** button on the tool you want to execute directly from the canvas view.
- Open the tool’s **Node Details View** and select **"Execute Step"** to run it from there.

If you have previously run the workflow, the input and output will be prefilled with data from the last execution. A pop-up form will open where you can manually fill in the parameters before executing your test.

### Extended logs view

### Insights enhancements for Enterprise

Two weeks after the launch of [Insights](../insights/), we’re releasing some enhancements designed for enterprise users.

- **Expanded time ranges**. You can now filter insights over a variety of time periods, from the last 24 hours up to 1 year. Pro users are limited to 7 day and 14 day views.
- **Hourly granularity**. Drill down into the last 24 hours of production executions with hourly granularity, making it easier to analyze workflows and quickly identify issues.

These updates provide deeper visibility into workflow history, helping you uncover trends over longer periods and detect problems sooner with more precise reporting.

### Extended HTTP Request tool functionality

We’ve brought the full power of the HTTP Request node to the HTTP Request tool in AI workflows. That means your AI Agents now have access to all the advanced configuration options—like Pagination, Batching, Timeout, Redirects, Proxy support, and even cURL import.

[](/_video/release-notes/http-request-tool.mp4)

This update also includes support for the `$fromAI` function to dynamically generate the right parameters based on the context of your prompt — making API calls smarter, faster, and more flexible than ever.

- Open your AI Agent node in the canvas.
- Click the **‘+’ icon** to add a new tool connection.
- In the **Tools panel**, select HTTP **Request Tool.**
- Configure it just like you would a regular **HTTP Request node** — including advanced options

👉 Learn more about configuring the [HTTP Request tool](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/).

Users on the Enterprise plan can now create API keys with specific scopes to control exactly what each key can access.

Previously, API keys had full read/write access across all endpoints. While sometimes necessary, this level of access can be excessive and too powerful for most use cases. Scoped API keys allow you to limit access to only the resources and actions a service or user actually needs.

When creating a new API key, you can now:

- Select whether the key has read, write, or both types of access.
- Specify which resources the key can interact with.

Supported scopes include:

- Variables — list, create, delete
- Security audit — generate reports
- Projects — list, create, update, delete
- Executions — list, read, delete
- Credentials — list, create, update, delete, move
- Workflows — list, create, update, delete, move, add/remove tags

Scoped API keys give you more control and security. You can limit access to only what’s needed, making it safer to work with third parties and easier to manage internal API usage.

### Drag and Drop in Folders

Folders just got friendlier. With this release, you can now **drag and drop workflows and folders** — making it even easier to keep things tidy.

Need to reorganize? Just select a workflow or folder and drag it into another folder or breadcrumb location. It’s a small change that makes a big difference when managing a growing collection of workflows.

[](/_video/release-notes/Drag-and-drop-folders.mp4)

📁 Folders are available to all [registered](../hosting/community-edition-features/#registered-community-edition) users—jump in and get your workspace in order!

We're rolling out [Insights](../insights/), a new dashboard to monitor how your workflows are performing over time. It's designed to give admins (and owners) better visibility of their most important workflow metrics and help troubleshoot potential issues and improvements.

In this first release, we’re introducing a summary banner, the insights dashboard, and time saved per execution.

#### 1. Summary banner

A new banner on the overview page that gives instance admins and owners a birds eye view of key metrics over the last 7 days.

Insights summary banner

- Total production executions
- Total failed executions
- Failure rate
- Average runtime of all workflows
- Estimated time saved

This overview is designed to help you stay on top of workflow activity at a glance. It is available for all plans and editions.

#### 2. Insights dashboard

On Pro and Enterprise plans, a new dashboard offers a deeper view into workflow performance and activity.

The dashboard includes:

- Total production executions over time, including a comparison of successful and failed executions
- Per-workflow breakdowns of key metrics
- Comparisons with previous periods to help spot changes in usage or behavior
- Runtime average and failure rate over time

#### 3. Time saved per execution

Within workflow settings, you can now assign a “time saved per execution” value to any workflow. This makes it possible to track the impact of your workflows and make it easier to share this visually with other teams and stakeholders.

This is just the beginning for Insights: the next phase will introduce more advanced filtering and comparisons, custom date ranges, and additional monitoring capabilities.

- We added a credential check for the Salesforce node
- We added SearXNG as a tool for AI agents

You can now search within subfolders, making it easier to find workflows across all folder levels. Just type in the search bar and go.

This release contains new features, new nodes, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) nodes

MCP aims to standardise how LLMs like Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor can interact with tools or integrate data for their agents. Many providers - both established or new - are adopting MCP as a standard way to build agentic systems. It is an easy way to either expose your own app as a server, making capabilities available to a model as tools, or as a client that can call on tools outside of your own system.

While it’s still early in the development process, we want to give you access to our new MCP nodes. This will help us understand your requirements better and will also let us converge on a great general solution quicker.

We are adding two new nodes:

- a MCP [Server Trigger](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcptrigger/) for any workflow
- a MCP [Client Tool](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolmcp/) for the AI Agent

The MCP Server Trigger turns n8n into an MCP server, providing n8n tools to models running outside of n8n. You can run multiple MCP servers from your n8n instance. The MCP Client Tool connects LLMs - and other intelligent agents - to any MCP-enabled service through a single interface.

Max from our DevRel team created an official walkthrough for you to get started:

[Studio Update #04](https://youtu.be/45WPU7P-1QQ?feature=shared)

### MCP Server Trigger

The MCP Server Trigger turns n8n into an MCP server, providing n8n tools to models running outside of n8n. The node acts as an entry point into n8n for MCP clients. It operates by exposing a URL that MCP clients can interact with to access n8n tools. This means your n8n workflows and integrations are now available to models run elsewhere. Pretty neat.

[Explore the MCP Server Trigger docs](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcptrigger/)

The MCP Client Tool node is a MCP client, allowing you to use the tools exposed by an external MCP server. You can connect the MCP Client Tool node to your models to call external tools with n8n agents. In this regard it is similar to using a n8n tool with your AI agent. One advantage is that the MCP Client Tool can access multiple tools on the MCP server at once, keeping your canvas cleaner and easier to understand.

[Explore the MCP Client Tool docs](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolmcp/)

- Added a node for Azure Cosmos DB
- Added a node for Milvus Vector Store
- Updated the Email Trigger (IMAP) node

What can we say about folders? Well, they’re super handy for categorizing just about everything and they’re finally available for your n8n workflows. Tidy up your workspace with unlimited folders and nested folders. Search for workflows within folders. It’s one of the ways we’re making it easier to organize your n8n instances more effectively.

Create and manage folders within your personal space or within projects. You can also create workflows from within a folder. You may need to restart your instance in order to activate folders.

It's a folder alright

Folders are available for all [registered](../hosting/community-edition-features/#registered-community-edition) users so get started with decluttering your workspace now and look for more features (like drag and drop) to organize your instances soon.

### Enhancements to Form Trigger Node

Recent updates to the Form Trigger node have made it a more powerful tool for building business solutions. These enhancements provide more flexibility and customization, enabling teams to create visually engaging and highly functional workflows with forms.

- **HTML customization:** Add custom HTML to forms, including embedded images and videos, for richer user experiences.
- **Custom CSS support**: Apply custom styles to user-facing components to align forms with your brand’s look and feel. Adjust fonts, colors, and spacing for a seamless visual identity.
- **Form previews:** Your form’s description and title will pull into previews of your form when sharing on social media or messaging apps, providing a more polished look.
- **Hidden fields:** Use query parameters to add hidden fields, allowing you to pass data—such as a referral source—without exposing it to the user.
- **New responses options:** Respond to user submissions in multiple ways including text, HTML, or a downloadable file (binary format). This enables forms to display rich webpages or deliver digital assets such as dynamically generated invoices or personalized certificates.

Form with custom CSS applied

These improvements elevate the Form Trigger node beyond a simple workflow trigger, transforming it into a powerful tool for addressing use cases from data collection and order processing to custom content creation.

This release contains bug fixes and an editor update.

Schema Preview lets you view and work with a node’s expected output without executing it or adding credentials, keeping you in flow while building.

- **See expected node outputs instantly.** View schemas for over 100+ nodes to help you design workflows efficiently without extra steps.
- **Define workflow logic first, take care of credentials later.** Build your end-to-end workflow without getting sidetracked by credential setup.
- **Avoid unwanted executions when building.** Prevent unnecessary API calls, unwanted data changes, or potential third-party service costs by viewing outputs without executing nodes.

- Add a node with Schema Preview support to your workflow.
- Open the next node in the sequence - Schema Preview data appears in the Node Editor where you would typically find it in the Schema View.
- Use Schema Preview fields just like other schema data - drag and drop them into parameters and settings as needed.

[](/_video/release-notes/Schema_preview.mp4)

Don’t forget to add the required credentials before putting your workflow into production.

Tidy up instantly aligns nodes, centers stickies, untangles connections, and brings structure to your workflows. Whether you're preparing to share a workflow or just want to improve readability, this feature saves you time and makes your logic easier to follow. Clean, well-organized workflows aren't just nicer to look at—they’re also quicker to understand.

Open the workflow you want to tidy, then choose one of these options:

- Click the **Tidy up** button in the bottom-left corner of the canvas (it looks like a broom 🧹)
- Press **Shift + Alt + T** on your keyboard
- Right-click anywhere on the canvas and select **Tidy up workflow**

Want to tidy up just part of your workflow? Select the specific nodes you want to clean up first - Tidy up will only adjust those, along with any stickies behind them.

[](/_video/release-notes/tidy_up.mp4)

### Multiple API keys

n8n now supports multiple API keys, allowing users to generate and manage separate keys for different workflows or integrations. This improves security by enabling easier key rotation and isolation of credentials. Future updates will introduce more granular controls.

This release contains bug fixes, a core update, editor improvements, and a node update.

### Improved partial executions

The new execution engine for partial executions ensures that testing parts of a workflow in the builder closely mirrors production behaviour. This makes iterating with updated run-data faster and more reliable, particularly for complex workflows.

Before, user would test parts of a workflow in the builder that didn't consistently reflect production behaviour, leading to unexpected results during development.

This update aligns workflow execution in the builder with production behavior.

Here is an example for loops:

### Improved consistency across environments

We added new UX and automatic changes improvements resulting in a better consistency between your staging and production instances.

Previously, users faced issues like:

- Lack of visibility into required credential updates when pulling changes
- Incomplete synchronization, where changes — such as deletions — weren’t always applied across environments
- Confusing commit process, making it unclear what was being pushed or pulled

We addressed these by:

- Clearly indicating required credential updates when pulling changes
- Ensuring deletions and other modifications sync correctly across environments
- Improving commit selection to provide better visibility into what’s being pushed

This release contains new features, a new node, node updates, performance improvements and bug fixes.

### Overhauled Code node editing experience

We added a ton of new helpers to the Code node, making edits of your code much faster and more comfortable. You get:

- TypeScript autocomplete
- TypeScript linting
- TypeScript hover tips
- Search and replace
- New keyboard shortcuts based on the VSCode keymap
- Auto-formatting using prettier (Alt+Shift+F)
- Remember folded regions and history after refresh
- Multi cursor
- Type function in the Code node using JSDoc types
- Drag and drop for all Code node modes
- Indentation markers

We build this on a web worker architecture so you won't have to suffer from performance degradation while typing.

To get the full picture, check out our Studio update with Max and Elias, where they discuss and demo the new editing experience. 👇

[Studio Update #04](https://youtu.be/De1E58MPaMQ?t=645)

### New node: Microsoft Entra ID

Microsoft Entra ID (formerly known as Microsoft Azure Active Directory or Azure AD) is used for cloud-based identity and access management. [The new node](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftentra/) supports a wide range of Microsoft Entra ID features, which includes creating, getting, updating, and deleting users and groups, as well as adding users to and removing them from groups.

- [AI Agent](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): Vector stores can now be directly used as tools for the agent
- [Code](../code/builtin/overview/): Tons of new speed and convenience features, see above for details
- [Google Vertex Chat](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatgooglevertex/): Added option to specify the GCP region for the Google API credentials
- [HighLevel](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.highlevel/): Added support for calendar items

We also added a custom [projects](../user-management/rbac/projects/) icon selector on top of the available emojis. Pretty!

We also added credential support for [SolarWinds IPAM](../integrations/builtin/credentials/solarwindsipam/) and [SolarWinds Observability](../integrations/builtin/credentials/solarwindsobservability/).

Last, but not least, we [improved the schema view performance in the node details view by 90%](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/12180) and added drag and drop re-ordering to parameters. This comes in very handy in the [If](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or [Edit Fields](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) nodes.

### Task runners for the Code node in public beta

We're introducing a significant performance upgrade to the Code node with our new Task runner system. This enhancement moves JavaScript code execution to a separate process, improving your workflow execution speed while adding better isolation.

Task runners overview

Our benchmarks show up to 6x improvement in workflow executions using Code nodes - from approximately 6 to 35 executions per second. All these improvements happen under the hood, keeping your Code node experience exactly the same.

The Task runner comes in two modes:

- Internal mode (default): Perfect for getting started, automatically managing task runners as child processes
- External mode: For advanced hosting scenarios requiring maximum isolation and security

Currently, this feature is opt-in and can be enabled using [environment variables](../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/). Once stable, it will become the default execution method for Code nodes.

To start using Task runners today, [check out the docs](../hosting/configuration/task-runners/).

- [AI Transform node](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aitransform/): We improved the prompt for code generation to transform data
- [Code node](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/): We added a warning if `pairedItem` is absent or could not be auto mapped

### New canvas in beta

The new canvas is now the default setting for all users. It should bring significant performance improvements and adds a handy minimap. As it is still a beta version you can still revert to the previous version with the three dot menu.

We're looking forward to your feedback. Should you encounter a bug, you will find a handy button to create an issue at the bottom of the new canvas as well.

- We added credential support for [Zabbix](../integrations/builtin/credentials/zabbix/) to the HTTP request node
- We added new OAuth2 credentials for [Microsoft SharePoint](../integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoft/)
- The [Slack node](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/#operations) now uses markdown for the approval message when using the `Send and Wait for Approval` operation

[Breaking change](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md)

What changed? Queue polling via the environment variable `QUEUE_RECOVERY_INTERVAL` has been removed.

When is action necessary? If you have set `QUEUE_RECOVERY_INTERVAL`, you can remove it as it no longer has any effect.

This release contains a new features, new nodes, node enhancements, and bug fixes.

### New node: n8n Form

Use the [n8n Form node](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/) to create user-facing forms with multiple pages. You can add other nodes with custom logic between to process user input. Start the workflow with a [n8n Form Trigger](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/).

A multi-page form with branching

Additionally you can:

- Set default selections with query parameters
- Define the form with a JSON array of objects
- Show a completion screen and redirect to another URL

- [Google Business Profile](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebusinessprofile/) and [Google Business Profile Trigger](../integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebusinessprofiletrigger/): Use these to integrate Google Business Profile reviews and posts with your workflows

- [AI Agent](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): Removed the requirement to add at least one tool
- [GitHub](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.github/): Added workflows as a resource operation
- [Structured Output Parser](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/): Added more user-friendly error messages

For additional security, we improved how we handle multi-factor authentication, hardened config file permissions and introduced JWT for the public API.

For better performance, we improved how partial executions are handled in loops.

This release contains a new node, node enhancements, performance improvements and bug fixes.

### Enhanced node: Remove Duplicates

The [Remove Duplicates node](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/) got a major makeover with the addition of two new operations:

- Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates
- Clear Deduplication History: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.

This makes it easier to only process new items from any data source. For example, you can now more easily poll a Google sheet for new entries by `id` or remove duplicate orders from the same customer by comparing their `order date`. The great thing is, you can now do this within **and across** workflow runs.

The new node for [Gong](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gong/) allows you to get users and calls to process them further in n8n. Very useful for sales related workflows.

[Breaking change](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md)

- The worker server used to bind to IPv6 by default. It now binds to IPv4 by default.
- The worker server's `/healthz` used to report healthy status based on database and Redis checks. It now reports healthy status regardless of database and Redis status, and the database and Redis checks are part of `/healthz/readiness`.

When is action necessary?

- If you experience a port conflict error when starting a worker server using its default port, set a different port for the worker server with `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_PORT`.
- If you are relying on database and Redis checks for worker health status, switch to checking `/healthz/readiness` instead of `/healthz`.

This release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.

- [OpenAI](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/): Added the option to choose between the default memory connector to provide memory to the assistant or to specify a thread ID
- [Gmail](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) and [Slack](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/): Added custom approval operations to have a human in the loop of a workflow

We have also optimized the [worker health checks](../hosting/logging-monitoring/monitoring/) (see breaking change above).

Each credential now has a seperate url you can link to. This makes sharing much easier.

This release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.

We skipped 1.62.0 and went straight to 1.62.1 with an additional fix.

#### Additional nodes as tools

We have made additional nodes usable with the [Tools AI Agent node](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/).

[](/_video/release-notes/nodes-as-tools.mp4)

Additionally, we have added a `$fromAI()` placeholder function to use with tools, allowing you to dynamically pass information from the models to the connected tools. This function works similarly to placeholders used elsewhere in n8n.

Both of these new features enable you to build even more powerful AI agents by drawing directly from the apps your business uses. This makes integrating LLMs into your business processes even easier than before.

- [Google BigQuery](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebigquery/): Added option to return numeric values as integers and not strings
- [HTTP Request](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/): Added credential support for Sysdig
- [Invoice Ninja](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.invoiceninja/): Additional query params for getAll requests
- [Question and Answer Chain](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/): Added the option to use a custom prompt

Drag and drop insertion on cursor position from schema view is now also enabled for code, SQL and Html fields in nodes.

Customers with an enterprise license can now rate, tag and highlight execution data in the executions view. To use highlighting, add an [Execution Data Node](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executiondata/) (or Code node) to the workflow to set [custom executions data](../workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/).

#### Queue metrics for workers

You can now [expose and consume metrics from your workers](../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/prometheus/). The worker instances have the same metrics available as the main instance(s) and can be configured with [environment variables](../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/endpoints/).

You can now customize the maximum file size when uploading files within forms to webhooks. The [environment variable to set](../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/endpoints/) for this is `N8N_FORMDATA_FILE_SIZE_MAX`. The default setting is 200MiB.

**Release date:** 2024-09-05

This release contains new features, bug fixes and feature enhancements.

#### New node: PGVector Vector Store

This release adds the PGVector Vector Store node. Use this node to interact with the PGVector tables in your PostgreSQL database. You can insert, get, and retrieve documents from a vector table to provide them to a retriever connected to a chain.

#### See active collaborators on workflows

We added collaborator avatars back to the workflow canvas. You will see other users who are active on the workflow, preventing you from overriding each other's work.

**Release date:** 2024-08-28

This release contains new features and bug fixes.

#### Improved execution queue handling

We are [exposing new execution queue metrics](../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/prometheus/) to give users more visibility of the queue length. This helps to inform decisions on horizontal scaling, based on queue status. We have also made querying executions faster.

#### New credentials for the HTTP Request node

We added credential support for Datadog, Dynatrace, Elastic Security, Filescan, Iris, and Malcore to the HTTP Request node making it easier to use existing credentials.

We also made it easier to select workflows as tools when working with AI agents by implementing a new `workflow selector` parameter type.

[Breaking change](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md)

The N8N_BLOCK_FILE_ACCESS_TO_N8N_FILES environment variable now also blocks access to n8n's static cache directory at ~/.cache/n8n/public.

If you are writing to or reading from a file at n8n's static cache directory via a node, e.g. Read/Write Files from Disk, please update your node to use a different path.

This release contains a new feature, a new node, a node update and bug fixes.

#### Override the npm registry

This release adds the option to override the npm registry for installing community packages. This is a paid feature.

We now also prevent npm downloading community packages from a compromised npm registry by explicitly using --registry in all npm install commands.

#### New node: AI Transform

This release adds the [AI Transform node](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aitransform/). Use the AI Transform node to generate code snippets based on your prompt. The AI is context-aware, understanding the workflow’s nodes and their data types. The node is only available on [Cloud plans](../manage-cloud/overview/).

This release adds the [Okta node](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.okta/). Use the Okta node to automate work in Okta and integrate Okta with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Okta features, which includes creating, updating, and deleting users.

- [MySQL](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mysql/)

This release contains new features, node enhancements, and bug fixes.

Although this release doesn't include a breaking change, it is a significant update including database migrations. n8n recommends backing up your data before updating to this version.

Credential sharing required for manual executions

Instance owners and admins: you will see changes if you try to manually execute a workflow where the credentials aren't shared with you. Manual workflow executions now use the same permissions checks as production executions, meaning you can't do a manual execution of a workflow if you don't have access to the credentials. Previously, owners and admins could do manual executions without credentials being shared with them. To resolve this, the credential creator needs to [share the credential](../credentials/credential-sharing/) with you.

#### New feature: Projects

With projects and roles, you can give your team access to collections of workflows and credentials, rather than having to share each workflow and credential individually. Simultaneously, you tighten security by limiting access to people on the relevant team.

Refer to the [RBAC](../user-management/rbac/) documentation for information on creating projects and using roles.

The number of projects and role types vary depending on your plan. Refer to [Pricing](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for details.

[](/_video/release-notes/rbac-glimpse.mp4)

#### New node: Slack Trigger

This release adds a trigger node for Slack. Refer to the [Slack Trigger documentation](../integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/) for details.

- Improved [memory support for OpenAI assistants](../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/).

### Rolling back to a previous version

If you update to this version, then decide you need to role back:

1. Delete any RBAC projects you created.
1. Revert the database migrations using `n8n db:revert`.

#### New feature: Ask AI in the HTTP node

You can now ask AI to help create API requests in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Ask AI**.
1. Enter the **Service** and **Request** you want to use. For example, to use the NASA API to get their picture of the day, enter `NASA` in **Service** and `get picture of the day` in **Request**.
1. Check the parameters: the AI tries to fill them out, but you may still need to adjust or correct the configuration.

Self-hosted users need to [enable AI features and provide their own API keys](../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/)

#### New node: Groq Chat Model

This release adds the [Groq Chat Model node](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatgroq/).

#### New nodes and improved experience for working with files

This release includes a major overhaul of nodes relating to files (binary data).

There are now three key nodes dedicated to handling binary data files:

- [Read/Write Files from Disk](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.
- [Convert to File](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to take input data and output it as a file.
- [Extract From File](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.

n8n has moved support for iCalendar, PDF, and spreadsheet formats into these nodes, and removed the iCalendar, Read PDF, and Spreadsheet File nodes. There are still standalone nodes for [HTML](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/) and [XML](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/).

#### New node: Qdrant vector store

This release adds support for [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) with the Qdrant vector store node.

## LangChain in n8n (beta)

**Release date:** 2023-10-04

This release introduces support for building with LangChain in n8n.

With n8n's LangChain nodes you can build AI-powered functionality within your workflows. The LangChain nodes are configurable, meaning you can choose your preferred agent, LLM, memory, and other components. Alongside the LangChain nodes, you can connect any n8n node as normal: this means you can integrate your LangChain logic with other data sources and services.

- This is a beta release, and not yet available in the main product. Follow the instructions in [Access LangChain in n8n](../advanced-ai/langchain/overview/) to try it out. Self-hosted and Cloud options are available.
- Learn how LangChain concepts map to n8n nodes in [LangChain concepts in n8n](../advanced-ai/langchain/langchain-n8n/).
- Browse n8n's new [Cluster nodes](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/). This is a new set of node types that allows for multiple nodes to work together to configure each other.

## RAG in n8n

**URL:** llms-txt#rag-in-n8n

**Contents:**
- What is RAG
- What is a vector store?
- How to use RAG in n8n
  - Inserting data into your vector store
  - Querying your data
  - Using agents
  - Using the node directly
- FAQs
  - How do I choose the right embedding model?
  - What is the best text splitting for my use case?

[Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](../../glossary/#ai-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) is a technique that improves AI responses by combining language models with external data sources. Instead of relying solely on the model's internal training data, RAG systems retrieve relevant documents to [ground](../../glossary/#ai-groundedness) responses in up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge. RAG workflows typically rely on vector stores to manage and search this external data efficiently.

## What is a vector store?

A [vector store](../../glossary/#ai-vector-store) is a special database designed to store and search high-dimensional vectors: numerical representations of text, images, or other data. When you upload a document, the vector store splits it into chunks and converts each chunk into a vector using an [embedding model](../../glossary/#ai-embedding).

You can query these vectors using similarity searches, which construct results based on *semantic meaning*, rather than keyword matches. This makes vector stores a powerful foundation for RAG and other AI systems that need to retrieve and reason over large sets of knowledge.

## How to use RAG in n8n

Start with a RAG template

👉 Try out RAG in n8n with the [RAG Starter Template](https://n8n.io/workflows/5010-rag-starter-template-using-simple-vector-stores-form-trigger-and-openai). The template includes two ready-made workflows: one for uploading files and one for querying them.

### Inserting data into your vector store

Before your agent can access custom knowledge, you need to upload that data to a vector store:

1. Add the nodes needed to fetch your source data.
1. Insert a **Vector Store** node (e.g. the [Simple Vector Store](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstoreinmemory/)) and choose the **Insert Documents** operation.
1. Select an **embedding model**, which converts your text into vector embeddings. Consult the FAQ for more information on [choosing the right embedding model](#how-do-i-choose-the-right-embedding-model).
1. Add a [Default Data Loader](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) node, which splits your content into chunks. You can use the default settings or define your own chunking strategy:
   - **Character Text Splitter:** splits by character length.
   - **Recursive Character Text Splitter:** recursively splits by Markdown, HTML, code blocks or simple characters (recommended for most use cases).
   - **Token Text Splitter:** splits by token count.
1. (Optional) Add **metadata** to each chunk to enrich the context and allow better filtering later.

### Querying your data

You can query the data in two main ways: using an agent or directly through a node.

1. Add an [agent](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to your workflow.
1. Add the vector store as a **tool** and give it a **description** to help the agent understand when to use it:
   - Set the **limit** to define how many chunks to return.
   - Enable **Include Metadata** to provide extra context for each chunk.
1. Add the same **embedding model** you used when inserting the data.

To save tokens on an expensive model, you can first use the [Vector Store Question Answer tool](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to retrieve relevant data, and only then pass the result to the Agent. To see this in action, check out [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/5011-save-costs-in-rag-workflows-using-the-qanda-tool-with-multiple-models).

### Using the node directly

1. Add your vector store node to the canvas and choose the **Get Many** operation.
1. Enter a query or prompt:
   - Set a **limit** for how many chunks to return.
   - Enable **Include Metadata** if needed.

### How do I choose the right embedding model?

The right embedding model differs from case to case.

In general, smaller models (for example, `text-embedding-ada-002`) are faster and cheaper and thus ideal for short, general-purpose documents or lightweight RAG workflows. Larger models (for example, `text-embedding-3-large`) offer better semantic understanding. These are best for long documents, complex topics, or when accuracy is critical.

### What is the best text splitting for my use case?

This again depends a lot on your data:

- Small chunks (for example, 200 to 500 tokens) are good for fine-grained retrieval.
- Large chunks may carry more context but can become diluted or noisy.

Using the right overlap size is important for the AI to understand the context of the chunk. That's also why using the Markdown or Code Block splitting can often help to make chunks better.

Another good approach is to add more context to it (for example, about the document where the chunk came from). If you want you can read more about this, you can check out [this great article from Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval).

## Dropbox credentials

**URL:** llms-txt#dropbox-credentials

**Contents:**
- Supported authentication methods
- Related resources
- Using access token
- Using OAuth2

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Dropbox](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.dropbox/)

## Supported authentication methods

- API access token: Dropbox recommends this method for testing with your user account and granting a limited number of users access.
- OAuth2: Dropbox recommends this method for production or for testing with more than 50 users.

You can transition an app from the API access token to OAuth2 by creating a new credential in n8n for OAuth2 using the same app.

Refer to [Dropbox's Developer documentation](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation) for more information about the service.

## Using access token

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/developers) developer account and:

- An **Access Token**: Generated once you create a Dropbox app.
- An **App Access Type**

To set up the credential, create a Dropbox app:

1. Open the [App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) within the Dropbox developer portal.
1. Select **Create app**.
1. In **Choose an API**, select **Scoped access**.
1. In **Choose the type of access you need**, choose whichever option best fits your use of the [Dropbox](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.dropbox/) node:
   - **App Folder** grants access to a single folder created specifically for your app.
   - **Full Dropbox** grants access to all files and folders in your user's Dropbox.
   - Refer to the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide) for more information.
1. In **Name your app**, enter a name for your app, like `n8n integration`.
1. Check the box to agree to the **Dropbox API Terms and Conditions**.
1. Select **Create app**. The app's **Settings** open.
1. In the **OAuth 2** section, in **Generated access token**, select **Generate**.
1. Copy the access token and enter it as the **Access Token** in your n8n credential.
1. In n8n, select the same **App Access Type** you selected for your app.

Refer to the [Dropbox App Console Settings documentation](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/getting-started) for more information.

On the **Settings** tab, you can add other users to your app, even with the access token method. Once your app links 50 Dropbox users, you will have two weeks to apply for and receive production status approval before Dropbox freezes your app from linking more users.

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

Cloud users need to select the **App Access Type**:

- **App Folder** grants access to a single folder created specifically for your app.
- **Full Dropbox** grants access to all files and folders in your user's Dropbox.
- Refer to the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide) for more information.

If you're [self-hosting](../../../../hosting/) n8n, you'll need to configure OAuth2 manually:

1. Open the [App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) within the Dropbox developer portal.
1. Select **Create app**.
1. In **Choose an API**, select **Scoped access**.
1. In **Choose the type of access you need**, choose whichever option best fits your use of the [Dropbox](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.dropbox/) node:
   - **App Folder** grants access to a single folder created specifically for your app.
   - **Full Dropbox** grants access to all files and folders in your user's Dropbox.
   - Refer to the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide) for more information.
1. In **Name your app**, enter a name for your app, like `n8n integration`.
1. Check the box to agree to the **Dropbox API Terms and Conditions**.
1. Select **Create app**. The app's **Settings** open.
1. Copy the **App key** and enter it as the **Client ID** in your n8n credential.
1. Copy the **Secret** and enter it as the **Client Secret** in your n8n credential.
1. In n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and enter it in the Dropbox **Redirect URIs**.
1. In n8n, select the same **App Access Type** you selected for your app.

Refer to the instructions in the [Dropbox Implementing OAuth documentation](https://developers.dropbox.com/oauth-guide#implementing-oauth) for more information.

For internal tools and limited usage, you can keep your app private. But if you'd like your app to be used by more than 50 users or you want to distribute it, you'll need to complete Dropbox's production approval process. Refer to **Production Approval** in the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide) for more information.

On the **Settings** tab, you can add other users to your app. Once your app links 50 Dropbox users, you will have two weeks to apply for and receive production status approval before Dropbox freezes your app from linking more users.

## Zep credentials

**URL:** llms-txt#zep-credentials

**Contents:**
- Supported authentication methods
- Related resources
- Using API key
  - Zep Cloud setup
  - Self-hosted Zep Open Source setup

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Zep](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryzep/)
- [Zep Vector Store](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorezep/)

## Supported authentication methods

Refer to [Zep's Cloud SDK documentation](https://help.getzep.com/install-sdks) for more information about the service. Refer to [Zep's REST API documentation](https://getzep.github.io/zep/) for information about the API.

View n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Zep server](https://www.getzep.com/) with at least one project and:

- An **API URL**
- An **API Key**

Setup depends on whether you're using Zep Cloud or self-hosted Zep Open Source.

Follow these instructions if you're using [Zep Cloud](https://app.getzep.com):

1. In Zep, open the **Project Settings**.
1. In the **Project Keys** section, select **Add Key**.
1. Enter a **Key Name**, like `n8n integration`.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Copy the key and enter it in your n8n integration as the **API Key**.
1. Turn on the **Cloud** toggle.

### Self-hosted Zep Open Source setup

The Zep team [deprecated the open source Zep Community Edition](https://blog.getzep.com/announcing-a-new-direction-for-zeps-open-source-strategy/) in April, 2025. These instructions may not work in the future.

Follow these instructions if you're self-hosting Zep Open Source:

1. Enter the JWT token for your Zep server as the **API Key** in n8n.
1. Make sure the **Cloud** toggle is off.
1. Enter the URL for your Zep server as the **API URL**.

## Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)

**URL:** llms-txt#lightweight-directory-access-protocol-(ldap)

**Contents:**
- Enable LDAP
- Merging n8n and LDAP accounts
- LDAP user accounts in n8n
- Turn LDAP off

- Available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Cloud Enterprise plans.
- You need access to the n8n instance owner account.

This page tells you how to enable LDAP in n8n. It assumes you're familiar with LDAP, and have an existing LDAP server set up.

LDAP allows users to sign in to n8n with their organization credentials, instead of an n8n login.

1. Log in to n8n as the instance owner.
1. Select **Settings** > **LDAP**.
1. Toggle on **Enable LDAP Login**.
1. Complete the fields with details from your LDAP server.
1. Select **Test connection** to check your connection setup, or **Save connection** to create the connection.

After enabling LDAP, anyone on your LDAP server can sign in to the n8n instance, unless you exclude them using the **User Filter** setting.

You can still create non-LDAP users (email users) on the **Settings** > **Users** page.

## Merging n8n and LDAP accounts

If n8n finds matching accounts (matching emails) for email users and LDAP users, the user must sign in with their LDAP account. n8n instance owner accounts are excluded from this: n8n never converts owner accounts to LDAP users.

## LDAP user accounts in n8n

On first sign in, n8n creates a user account in n8n for the LDAP user.

You must manage user details on the LDAP server, not in n8n. If you update or delete a user on your LDAP server, the n8n account updates at the next scheduled sync, or when the user next tries to log in, whichever happens first.

If you remove a user from your LDAP server, they lose n8n access on the next sync.

1. Log in to n8n as the instance owner.
1. Select **Settings** > **LDAP**.
1. Toggle off **Enable LDAP Login**.

If you turn LDAP off, n8n converts existing LDAP users to email users on their next login. The users must reset their password.

## Configure the Base URL for n8n's front end access

**URL:** llms-txt#configure-the-base-url-for-n8n's-front-end-access

Requires manual UI build

This use case involves configuring the `VUE_APP_URL_BASE_API` environmental variable which requires a manual build of the `n8n-editor-ui` package. You can't use it with the default n8n Docker image where the default setting for this variable is `/`, meaning that it uses the root-domain.

You can configure the Base URL that the front end uses to connect to the back end's REST API. This is relevant when you want to host n8n's front end and back end separately.

Refer to [Environment variables reference](../../environment-variables/deployment/) for more information on this variable.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
export VUE_APP_URL_BASE_API=https://n8n.example.com/
```

## Data mocking

**URL:** llms-txt#data-mocking

**Contents:**
- Mocking with real data using data pinning
- Generate custom data using the Code or Edit Fields nodes
- Output a sample data set from the Customer Datastore node

Data mocking is simulating or faking data. It's useful when developing a workflow. By mocking data, you can:

- Avoid making repeated calls to your data source. This saves time and costs.
- Work with a small, predictable dataset during initial development.
- Avoid the risk of overwriting live data: in the early stages of building your workflow, you don't need to connect your real data source.

## Mocking with real data using data pinning

Using [data pinning](../data-pinning/), you load real data into your workflow, then pin it in the output panel of a node. Using this approach you have realistic data, with only one call to your data source. You can [edit pinned data](../data-editing/).

Use this approach when you need to configure your workflow to handle the exact data structure and parameters provided by your data source.

To pin data in a node:

1. Run the node to load data.
1. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **Pin data** . When data pinning is active, the button is disabled and a "This data is pinned" banner is displayed in the **OUTPUT** view.

Nodes that output binary data

You can't pin data if the output data includes binary data.

## Generate custom data using the Code or Edit Fields nodes

You can create a custom dataset in your workflow using either the [Code node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) or the [Edit Fields (Set) node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/).

In the Code node, you can create any data set you want, and return it as the node output. In the Edit Fields node, select **Add fields** to add your custom data.

The Edit Fields node is a good choice for small tests. To create more complex datasets, use the Code node.

## Output a sample data set from the Customer Datastore node

The Customer Datastore node provides a fake dataset to work with. Add and execute the node to explore the data.

Use this approach if you need some test data when exploring n8n, and you don't have a real use-case to work with.

## Item linking concepts

**URL:** llms-txt#item-linking-concepts

**Contents:**
- n8n's automatic item linking
- Item linking example

Each output item created by a node includes metadata that links them to the input item (or items) that the node used to generate them. This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. This can be complicated to understand, especially if the node splits or merges data. You need to understand item linking when building your own programmatic nodes, or in some scenarios using the Code node.

This document provides a conceptual overview of this feature. For usage details, refer to:

- [Item linking for node creators](../item-linking-node-building/), for details on how to handle item linking when building a node.
- [Item linking in the Code node](../item-linking-code-node/), to learn how to handle item linking in the Code node.
- [Item linking errors](../item-linking-errors/), to understand the errors you may encounter in the editor UI.

## n8n's automatic item linking

If a node doesn't control how to link input items to output items, n8n tries to guess how to link the items automatically:

- Single input, single output: the output links to the input.
- Single input, multiple outputs: all outputs link to that input.
- Multiple inputs and outputs:
  - If you keep the input items, but change the order (or remove some but keep others), n8n can automatically add the correct linked item information.
  - If the number of inputs and outputs is equal, n8n links the items in order. This means that output-1 links to input-1, output-2 to input-2, and so on.
  - If the number isn't equal, or you create completely new items, n8n can't automatically link items.

If n8n can't link items automatically, and the node doesn't handle the item linking, n8n displays an error. Refer to [Item linking errors](../item-linking-errors/) for more information.

## Item linking example

In this example, it's possible for n8n to link an item in one node back several steps, despite the item order changing. This means the node that sorts movies alphabetically can access information about the linked item in the node that gets famous movie actors.

The methods for accessing linked items are different depending on whether you're using the UI, expressions, or the code node. Explore the following resources:

- [Mapping in the UI](../../data-mapping-ui/)
- [Mapping in the expressions editor](../../data-mapping-expressions/)
- [Item linking in the Code node](../item-linking-code-node/)
- [Item linking errors](../item-linking-errors/)

## Set up SSL

**URL:** llms-txt#set-up-ssl

**Contents:**
- Use a reverse proxy (recommended)
- Pass certificates into n8n directly

There are two methods to support TLS/SSL in n8n.

## Use a reverse proxy (recommended)

Use a reverse proxy like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) or a Network Load Balancer (NLB) in front of the n8n instance. This should also take care of certificate renewals.

Refer to [Security | Data encryption](https://n8n.io/legal/#security) for more information.

## Pass certificates into n8n directly

You can also choose to pass certificates into n8n directly. To do so, set the `N8N_SSL_CERT` and `N8N_SSL_KEY` environment variables to point to your generated certificate and key file.

You'll need to make sure the certificate stays renewed and up to date.

Refer to [Deployment environment variables](../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) for more information on these variables and [Configuration](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on setting environment variables.

Refer to [Azure OpenAI's API documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference) for more information about the service.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Resource Name**: the **Name** you give the resource
- An **API key**: **Key 1** works well. This can be accessed before deployment in **Keys and Endpoint**.
- The **API Version** the credentials should use. See the [Azure OpenAI API preview lifecycle documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/api-version-deprecation) for more information about API versioning in Azure OpenAI.

To get the information above, [create and deploy an Azure OpenAI Service resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource).

Model name for Azure OpenAI nodes

Once you deploy the resource, use the **Deployment name** as the model name for the Azure OpenAI nodes where you're using this credential.

## Using Azure Entra ID (OAuth2)

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

For self-hosted users, there are two main steps to configure OAuth2 from scratch:

1. [Register an application](#register-an-application) with the Microsoft Identity Platform.
1. [Generate a client secret](#generate-a-client-secret) for that application.

Follow the detailed instructions for each step below. For more detail on the Microsoft OAuth2 web flow, refer to [Microsoft authentication and authorization basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts).

### Register an application

Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform:

1. Open the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://aka.ms/appregistrations).
1. Select **Register an application**.
1. Enter a **Name** for your app.
1. In **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Skype, Xbox)**.
1. In **Register an application**:
   1. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from your n8n credential.
   1. Paste it into the **Redirect URI (optional)** field.
   1. Select **Select a platform** > **Web**.
1. Select **Register** to finish creating your application.
1. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and paste it into n8n as the **Client ID**.

Refer to [Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2) for more information.

### Generate a client secret

With your application created, generate a client secret for it:

1. On your Microsoft application page, select **Certificates & secrets** in the left navigation.
1. In **Client secrets**, select **+ New client secret**.
1. Enter a **Description** for your client secret, such as `n8n credential`.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Copy the **Secret** in the **Value** column.
1. Paste it into n8n as the **Client Secret**.
1. Select **Connect my account** in n8n to finish setting up the connection.
1. Log in to your Microsoft account and allow the app to access your info.

Refer to Microsoft's [Add credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#add-credentials) for more information on adding a client secret.

## Setting custom scopes

Azure Entra ID credentials use the following scopes by default:

- [`openid`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#the-openid-scope)
- [`offline_access`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#the-offline_access-scope)

This page describes the purpose of each table in the n8n database.

## Database and query technology

By default, n8n uses SQLite as the database. If you are using another database the structure will be similar, but the data-types may be different depending on the database.

n8n uses [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) for queries and migrations.

To inspect the n8n database, you can use [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io), which is an open-source universal database tool.

These are the tables n8n creates during setup.

Stores details of external authentication providers when using [SAML](../../../user-management/saml/).

### auth_provider_sync_history

Stores the history of a SAML connection.

### credentials_entity

Stores the [credentials](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n) used to authenticate with integrations.

### event_destinations

Contains the destination configurations for [Log streaming](../../../log-streaming/).

Contains the workflow at time of running, and the execution data.

Stores all saved workflow executions. Workflow settings can affect which executions n8n saves.

### execution_metadata

Stores [Custom executions data](../../../workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/).

Lists the [community nodes](../../../integrations/community-nodes/installation/) installed in your n8n instance.

### installed_packages

Details of npm community nodes packages installed in your n8n instance. [installed_nodes](#installed_nodes) lists each individual node. `installed_packages` lists npm packages, which may contain more than one node.

A log of all database migrations. Read more about [Migrations](https://typeorm.io/docs/advanced-topics/migrations/) in TypeORM's documentation.

Lists the [projects](../../../user-management/rbac/projects/) in your instance.

Describes the relationship between a user and a [project](../../../user-management/rbac/projects/), including the user's [role type](../../../user-management/rbac/role-types/).

Not currently used. For use in future work on custom roles.

Records custom instance settings. These are settings that you can't control using environment variables. They include:

- Whether the instance owner is set up
- Whether the user chose to skip owner and user management setup
- Whether certain types of authentication, including SAML and LDAP, are on
- License key

### shared_credentials

Maps credentials to users.

Maps workflows to users.

All workflow tags created in the n8n instance. This table lists the tags. [workflows_tags](#workflows_tags) records which workflows have which tags.

Store [variables](../../../code/variables/).

Records the active webhooks in your n8n instance's workflows. This isn't just webhooks uses in the Webhook node. It includes all active webhooks used by any trigger node.

Your n8n instance's saved workflows.

Store previous versions of workflows.

### workflow_statistics

Counts workflow IDs and their status.

Maps tags to workflows. [tag_entity](#tag_entity) contains tag details.

## MySQL credentials

**URL:** llms-txt#mysql-credentials

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Supported authentication methods
- Related resources
- Using database connection

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [MySQL](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mysql/)
- [Agent](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/)

The Agent node doesn't support SSH tunnels.

Create a user account on a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) server database.

## Supported authentication methods

- Database connection

Refer to [MySQL's documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.3/en/) for more information about the service.

## Using database connection

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The server **Host**: The database's host name or IP address.
- The **Database** name.
- A **User** name.
- A **Password** for that user.
- The **Port** number used by the MySQL server.
- **Connect Timeout**: The number of milliseconds during the initial database connection before a timeout occurs.
- **SSL**: If your database is using SSL, turn this on and add details for the SSL certificate.
- **SSH Tunnel**: Choose whether to connect over an SSH tunnel. An SSH tunnel lets un-encrypted traffic pass over an encrypted connection and enables authorized remote access to servers protected from outside connections by a firewall.

To set up your database connection credential:

1. Enter your database's hostname as the **Host** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the hostname:

1. Enter your database's name as the **Database** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the database name:

1. Enter the username of a **User** in the database. This user should have appropriate permissions for whatever actions you want n8n to perform.

1. Enter the **Password** for that user.

1. Enter the **Port** number used by the MySQL server (default is `3306`). Run this query to confirm the port number:

1. Enter the **Connect Timeout** you'd like the node to use. The Connect Timeout is the number of milliseconds during the initial database connection the node should wait before timing out. n8n defaults to `10000` which is the default used by MySQL of 10 seconds. If you want to match your database's `connect_timeout`, run this query to get it, then multiply by 1000 before entering it in n8n:

1. If your database uses SSL and you'd like to use **SSL** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. If you turn it on, enter the information from your MySQL SSL certificate in these fields:

1. Enter the `ca.pem` file contents in the **CA Certificate** field.
   1. Enter the `client-key.pem` file contents in the **Client Private Key** field.
   1. Enter the `client-cert.pem` file contents in the **Client Certificate** field.

1. If you want to use **SSH Tunnel** for the connection, turn this option on in the credential. Otherwise, skip it. If you turn it on:

1. Select the **SSH Authenticate with** to set the SSH Tunnel type to build:
      - Select **Password** if you want to connect to SSH using a password.
      - Select **Private Key** if you want to connect to SSH using an identity file (private key) and a passphrase.
   1. Enter the **SSH Host**. n8n uses this host to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
   1. Enter the **SSH Port**. n8n uses this port to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
   1. Enter the **SSH User** to connect with. n8n uses this user to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.
   1. If you selected **Password** for **SSH Authenticate with**, add the **SSH Password**.
   1. If you selected **Private Key** for **SSH Authenticate with**:
      1. Add the contents of the **Private Key** or identity file used for SSH. This is the same as using the `ssh-identity-file` option with the `shell-connect()` command in MySQL.
      1. If the **Private Key** was created with a passphrase, enter that **Passphrase**. This is the same as using the `ssh-identity-pass` option with the `shell-connect()` command in MySQL. If the **Private Key** has no passphrase, leave this field blank.

Refer to [MySQL | Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-ssl-rsa-files.html) for more information on working with SSL certificates in MySQL. Refer to [MySQL | Using an SSH Tunnel](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-connection-ssh.html) for more information on working with SSH tunnels in MySQL.

API JWT token deprecation

Zoom removed support for JWT access tokens in June 2023. You must use OAuth2 for all new credentials.

Refer to [Zoom's API documentation](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/) for more information about the service.

## Using API JWT token

This authentication method has been fully deprecated by Zoom. Don't create new credentials with it.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **JWT token**: To create a JWT token, create a new JWT app in the [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/).

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**: Generated when you create an OAuth app on the Zoom App Marketplace.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated when you create an OAuth app.

To generate your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, [create an OAuth app](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/create/).

Use these settings for your OAuth app:

- Select **User-managed app** for **Select how the app is managed**.
- Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and enter it as an **OAuth Redirect URL** in Zoom.
- If your n8n credential displays a **Whitelist URL**, also enter that URL as a an **OAuth Redirect URL**.
- Enter **Scopes** for the scopes you plan to use. For all functionality in the [Zoom](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.zoom/) node, select:
  - `meeting:read`
  - `meeting:write`
  - Refer to [OAuth scopes | Meeting scopes](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/oauth-scopes/#meeting-scopes) for more information on meeting scopes.
- Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** provided in the Zoom app and enter them in your n8n credential.

## What's a tool in AI?

**URL:** llms-txt#what's-a-tool-in-ai?

**Contents:**
- AI tools in n8n

In AI, 'tools' has a specific meaning. Tools act like addons that your AI can use to access extra context or resources.

Here are a couple of other ways of expressing it:

> Tools are interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world ([source](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/tool-calling/))

> We can think of these tools as being almost like functions that your AI model can call ([source](https://www.udemy.com/course/chatgpt-and-langchain-the-complete-developers-masterclass/))

n8n provides tool [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that you can connect to your [AI agent](../../../glossary/#ai-agent). As well as providing some popular tools, such as [Wikipedia](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolwikipedia/) and [SerpAPI](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolserpapi/), n8n provides three especially powerful tools:

- [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/): use this to load any n8n workflow as a tool.
- [Custom Code Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode/): write code that your agent can run.
- [HTTP Request Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/): make calls to fetch a website or data from an API.

The next three examples highlight the Call n8n Workflow Tool:

- [Chat with Google Sheets](../data-google-sheets/)
- [Call an API to fetch data](../api-workflow-tool/)
- [Set up a human fallback](../human-fallback/)

You can also learn how to [let AI dynamically specify parameters for tools with the `$fromAI()` function](../using-the-fromai-function/).

## External secrets

**URL:** llms-txt#external-secrets

**Contents:**
- Connect n8n to your secrets store
- Use secrets in n8n credentials
- Using external secrets with n8n environments
- Using external secrets in projects
- Troubleshooting
  - Infisical version changes
  - Only set external secrets on credentials owned by an instance owner or admin

- External secrets are available on Enterprise Self-hosted and Enterprise Cloud plans.
- n8n supports AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secrets Manager, Infisical and HashiCorp Vault.
- n8n doesn't support [HashiCorp Vault Secrets](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/vault-secrets).

You can use an external secrets store to manage [credentials](../glossary/#credential-n8n) for n8n.

n8n stores all credentials encrypted in its database, and restricts access to them by default. With the external secrets feature, you can store sensitive credential information in an external vault, and have n8n load it in when required. This provides an extra layer of security and allows you to manage credentials used across multiple [n8n environments](../source-control-environments/) in one central place.

## Connect n8n to your secrets store

Your secret names can't contain spaces, hyphens, or other special characters. n8n supports secret names containing alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, and `0-9`), and underscores. n8n currently only supports plaintext values for secrets, not JSON objects or key-value pairs.

1. In n8n, go to **Settings** > **External Secrets**.

1. Select **Set Up** for your store provider.

1. Enter the credentials for your provider:

- Azure Key Vault: Provide your **vault name**, **tenant ID**, **client ID**, and **client secret**. Refer to the Azure documentation to [register a Microsoft Entra ID app and create a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal). n8n supports only single-line values for secrets.

- AWS Secrets Manager: provide your **access key ID**, **secret access key**, and **region**. The IAM user must have the `secretsmanager:ListSecrets`, `secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue`, and `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permissions.

To give n8n access to all secrets in your AWS Secrets Manager, you can attach the following policy to the IAM user:

You can also be more restrictive and give n8n access to select specific AWS Secret Manager secrets. You still need to allow the `secretsmanager:ListSecrets` and `secretsmanager:BatchGetSecretValue` permissions to access all resources. These permissions allow n8n to retrieve ARN-scoped secrets, but don't provide access to the secret values.

Next, you need set the scope for the `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` permission to the specific Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for the secrets you wish to share with n8n. Ensure you use the correct region and account ID in each resource ARNs. You can find the ARN details in the AWS dashboard for your secrets.

For example, the following IAM policy only allows access to secrets with a name starting with `n8n` in your specified AWS account and region:

For more IAM permission policy examples, consult the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_iam-policies.html#auth-and-access_examples_batch).

- HashiCorp Vault: provide the **Vault URL** for your vault instance, and select your **Authentication Method**. Enter your authentication details. Optionally provide a namespace.

- Refer to the HashiCorp documentation for your authentication method: [Token auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/token)\
       [AppRole auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/approle)\
       [Userpass auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/userpass)
     - If you use vault namespaces, you can enter the namespace n8n should connect to. Refer to [Vault Enterprise namespaces](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/namespaces) for more information on HashiCorp Vault namespaces.

- Infisical: provide a **Service Token**. Refer to Infisical's [Service token](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/token) documentation for information on getting your token. If you self-host Infisical, enter the **Site URL**.

Infisical environment

Make sure you select the correct Infisical environment when creating your token. n8n will load secrets from this environment, and won't have access to secrets in other Infisical environments. n8n only support service tokens that have access to a single environment.

n8n doesn't support [Infisical folders](https://infisical.com/docs/documentation/platform/folder).

- Google Cloud Platform: provide a **Service Account Key** (JSON) for a service account that has at least these roles: `Secret Manager Secret Accessor` and `Secret Manager Secret Viewer`. Refer to Google's [service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview) for more information.

1. **Save** your configuration.

1. Enable the provider using the **Disabled / Enabled** toggle.

## Use secrets in n8n credentials

To use a secret from your store in an n8n credential:

1. Create a new credential, or open an existing one.

1. On the field where you want to use a secret:

1. Hover over the field.
   1. Select **Expression**.

1. In the field where you want to use a secret, enter an [expression](../glossary/#expression-n8n) referencing the secret name:

`<vault-name>` is either `vault` (for HashiCorp) or `infisical` or `awsSecretsManager`. Replace `<secret-name>` with the name as it appears in your vault.

## Using external secrets with n8n environments

n8n's [Source control and environments](../source-control-environments/) feature allows you to create different n8n environments, backed by Git. The feature doesn't support using different credentials in different instances. You can use an external secrets vault to provide different credentials for different environments by connecting each n8n instance to a different vault or project environment.

For example, you have two n8n instances, one for development and one for production. You use Infisical for your vault. In Infisical, create a project with two environments, development and production. Generate a token for each Infisical environment. Use the token for the development environment to connect your development n8n instance, and the token for your production environment to connect your production n8n instance.

## Using external secrets in projects

To use external secrets in an [RBAC project](../user-management/rbac/), you must have an [instance owner or instance admin](../user-management/account-types/) as a member of the project.

### Infisical version changes

Infisical version upgrades can introduce problems connecting to n8n. If your Infisical connection stops working, check if there was a recent version change. If so, report the issue to help@n8n.io.

### Only set external secrets on credentials owned by an instance owner or admin

Due to the permissions that instance owners and admins have, it's possible for owners and admins to update credentials owned by another user with a secrets expression. This will appear to work in preview for an instance owner or admin, but the secret won't resolve when the workflow runs in production.

Only use external secrets for credentials that are owned by an instance admin or owner. This ensures they resolve correctly in production.

AI agents are artificial intelligence systems capable of responding to requests, making decisions, and performing real-world tasks for users. They use large language models (LLMs) to interpret user input and make decisions about how to best process requests using the information and resources they have available.

AI chains allow you to interact with large language models (LLMs) and other resources in sequences of calls to components. AI chains in n8n don't use persistent memory, so you can't use them to reference previous context (use AI agents for this).

Completions are the responses generated by a model like GPT.

Embeddings are numerical representations of data using vectors. They're used by AI to interpret complex data and relationships by mapping values across many dimensions. Vector databases, or vector stores, are databases designed to store and access embeddings.

In AI, and specifically in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) contexts, groundedness and ungroundedness are measures of how much a model's responses accurately reflect source information. The model uses its source documents to generate grounded responses, while ungrounded responses involve speculation or hallucination unsupported by those same sources.

#### AI hallucination

Hallucination in AI is when an LLM (large language model) mistakenly perceives patterns or objects that don't exist.

Reranking is a technique that refines the order of a list of candidate documents to improve the relevance of search results. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other applications use reranking to prioritize the most relevant information for generation or downstream tasks.

In an AI context, memory allows AI tools to persist message context across interactions. This allows you to have a continuing conversations with AI agents, for example, without submitting ongoing context with each message. In n8n, AI agent nodes can use memory, but AI chains can't.

#### AI retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

Retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, is a technique for providing LLMs access to new information from external sources to improve AI responses. RAG systems retrieve relevant documents to ground responses in up-to-date, domain-specific, or proprietary knowledge to supplement their original training data. RAG systems often rely on vector stores to manage and search this external data efficiently.

In an AI context, a tool is an add-on resource that the AI can refer to for specific information or functionality when responding to a request. The AI model can use a tool to interact with external systems or complete specific, focused tasks.

A vector store, or vector database, stores mathematical representations of information. Use with embeddings and retrievers to create a database that your AI can access when answering questions.

APIs, or application programming interfaces, offer programmatic access to a service's data and functionality. APIs make it easier for software to interact with external systems. They're often offered as an alternative to traditional user-focused interfaces accessed through web browsers or UI.

The canvas is the main interface for building workflows in n8n's editor UI. You use the canvas to add and connect nodes to compose workflows.

#### cluster node (n8n)

In n8n, cluster nodes are groups of nodes that work together to provide functionality in a workflow. They consist of a root node and one or more sub nodes that extend the node's functionality.

#### credential (n8n)

In n8n, credentials store authentication information to connect with specific apps and services. After creating credentials with your authentication information (username and password, API key, OAuth secrets, etc.), you can use the associated app node to interact with the service.

#### data pinning (n8n)

Data pinning allows you to temporarily freeze the output data of a node during workflow development. This allows you to develop workflows with predictable data without making repeated requests to external services. Production workflows ignore pinned data and request new data on each execution.

The n8n editor UI allows you to create and manage workflows. The main area is the canvas, where you can compose workflows by adding, configuring, and connecting nodes. The side and top panels allow you to access other areas of the UI like credentials, templates, variables, executions, and more.

#### entitlement (n8n)

In n8n, entitlements grant n8n instances access to plan-restricted features for a specific period of time.

Floating entitlements are a pool of entitlements that you can distribute among various n8n instances. You can re-assign a floating entitlement to transfer its access to a different n8n instance.

#### evaluation (n8n)

In n8n, evaluation allows you to tag and organize execution history and compare it against new executions. You can use this to understand how your workflow performs over time as you make changes. In particular, this is useful while developing AI-centered workflows.

#### expression (n8n)

In n8n, expressions allow you to populate node parameters dynamically by executing JavaScript code. Instead of providing a static value, you can use the n8n expression syntax to define the value using data from previous nodes, other workflows, or your n8n environment.

LangChain is an AI-development framework used to work with large language models (LLMs). LangChain provides a standardized system for working with a wide variety of models and other resources and linking different components together to build complex applications.

#### Large language model (LLM)

Large language models, or LLMs, are AI machine learning models designed to excel in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They're built by training on large amounts of data to develop probabilistic models of language and other data.

In n8n, nodes are individual components that you compose to create workflows. Nodes define when the workflow should run, allow you to fetch, send, and process data, can define flow control logic, and connect with external services.

n8n projects allow you to separate workflows, variables, and credentials into separate groups for easier management. Projects make it easier for teams to collaborate by sharing and compartmentalizing related resources.

Each n8n cluster node contains a single root nodes that defines the main functionality of the cluster. One or more sub nodes attach to the root node to extend its functionality.

n8n cluster nodes consist of one or more sub nodes connected to a root node. Sub nodes extend the functionality of the root node, providing access to specific services or resources or offering specific types of dedicated processing, like calculator functionality, for example.

n8n templates are pre-built workflows designed by n8n and community members that you can import into your n8n instance. When using templates, you may need to fill in credentials and adjust the configuration to suit your needs.

#### trigger node (n8n)

A trigger node is a special node responsible for executing the workflow in response to certain conditions. All production workflows need at least one trigger to determine when the workflow should run.

An n8n workflow is a collection of nodes that automate a process. Workflows begin execution when a trigger condition occurs and execute sequentially to achieve complex tasks.

Use this operation to message a model or classify text for violations in OpenAI. Refer to [OpenAI](../) for more information on the OpenAI node itself.

Previous node versions

n8n version 1.117.0 introduces the OpenAI node V2 that supports the OpenAI Responses API. It renames the 'Message a Model' operation to 'Generate a Chat Completion' to clarify its association with the Chat Completions API and introduces a separate 'Generate a Model Response' operation that uses the Responses API.

## Generate a Chat Completion

Use this operation to send a message or prompt to an OpenAI model - using the Chat Completions API - and receive a response.

Enter these parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](../../../credentials/openai/).
- **Resource**: Select **Text**.
- **Operation**: Select **Generate a Chat Completion**.
- **Model**: Select the model you want to use. If you’re not sure which model to use, try `gpt-4o` if you need high intelligence or `gpt-4o-mini` if you need the fastest speed and lowest cost. Refer to [Models overview | OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for more information.
- **Messages**: Enter a **Text** prompt and assign a **Role** that the model will use to generate responses. Refer to [Prompt engineering | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) for more information on how to write a better prompt by using these roles. Choose from one of these roles:
  - **User**: Sends a message as a user and gets a response from the model.
  - **Assistant**: Tells the model to adopt a specific tone or personality.
  - **System**: By default, there is no system message. You can define instructions in the user message, but the instructions set in the system message are more effective. You can set more than one system message per conversation. Use this to set the model's behavior or context for the next user message.
- **Simplify Output**: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data.
- **Output Content as JSON**: Turn on to attempt to return the response in JSON format. Compatible with `GPT-4 Turbo` and all `GPT-3.5 Turbo` models newer than `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.

- **Frequency Penalty**: Apply a penalty to reduce the model's tendency to repeat similar lines. The range is between `0.0` and `2.0`.
- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Set the maximum number of tokens for the response. One token is roughly four characters for standard English text. Use this to limit the length of the output.
- **Number of Completions**: Defaults to 1. Set the number of completions you want to generate for each prompt. Use carefully since setting a high number will quickly consume your tokens.
- **Presence Penalty**: Apply a penalty to influence the model to discuss new topics. The range is between `0.0` and `2.0`.
- **Output Randomness (Temperature)**: Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between `0.0` (deterministic) and `1.0` (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Top P)** but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around `0.7`) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. Defaults to `1.0`.
- **Output Randomness (Top P)**: Adjust the Top P setting to control the diversity of the assistant's responses. For example, `0.5` means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered. We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Temperature)** but not both. Defaults to `1.0`.

Refer to [Chat Completions | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) documentation for more information.

## Generate a Model Response

Use this operation to send a message or prompt to an OpenAI model - using the Responses API - and receive a response.

Enter these parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](../../../credentials/openai/).
- **Resource**: Select **Text**.
- **Operation**: Select **Generate a Model Response**.
- **Model**: Select the model you want to use. Refer to [Models overview | OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for an overview.
- **Messages**: Choose from one of these a **Message Types**:
  - **Text**: Enter a **Text** prompt and assign a **Role** that the model will use to generate responses. Refer to [Prompt engineering | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) for more information on how to write a better prompt by using these roles.
  - **Image**: Provide an **Image** either through an Image URL, a File ID (using the [OpenAI Files API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files)) or by passing binary data from an earlier node in your workflow.
  - **File**: Provide a **File** in a supported format (currently: PDF only), either through a File URL, a File ID (using the [OpenAI Files API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files)) or by passing binary data from an earlier node in your workflow.
  - For any message type, you can choose from one of these roles:
    - **User**: Sends a message as a user and gets a response from the model.
    - **Assistant**: Tells the model to adopt a specific tone or personality.
    - **System**: By default, the system message is `"You are a helpful assistant"`. You can define instructions in the user message, but the instructions set in the system message are more effective. You can only set one system message per conversation. Use this to set the model's behavior or context for the next user message.
- **Simplify Output**: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data.

The OpenAI Responses API provides a range of [built-in tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools) to enrich the model's response:

- **Web Search**: Allows models to search the web for the latest information before generating a response.
- **MCP Servers**: Allows models to connect to remote MCP servers. Find out more about using remote MCP servers as tools [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp).
- **File Search**: Allow models to search your knowledgebase from previously uploaded files for relevant information before generating a response. Refer to the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search) for more information.
- **Code Interpreter**: Allows models to write and run Python code in a sandboxed environment.

- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Set the maximum number of tokens for the response. One token is roughly four characters for standard English text. Use this to limit the length of the output.
- **Output Randomness (Temperature)**: Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between `0.0` (deterministic) and `1.0` (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Top P)** but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around `0.7`) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. Defaults to `1.0`.
- **Output Randomness (Top P)**: Adjust the Top P setting to control the diversity of the assistant's responses. For example, `0.5` means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered. We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Temperature)** but not both. Defaults to `1.0`.
- **Conversation ID**: The conversation that this response belongs to. Input items and output items from this response are automatically added to this conversation after this response completes.
- **Previous Response ID**: The ID of the previous response to continue from. Can't be used in conjunction with Conversation ID.
- **Reasoning**: The level of reasoning effort the model should spend to generate the response. Includes the ability to return a **Summary** of the reasoning performed by the model (for example, for debugging purposes).

## Insights

**URL:** llms-txt#insights

**Contents:**
- Insights summary banner
- Insights dashboard
- Insights time periods
- Setting the time saved by a workflow
- Disable or configure insights metrics collection
- Insights FAQs
  - Which executions do n8n use to calculate the values in the insights banner and dashboard?
  - Does n8n use historic execution data when upgrading to a version with insights?

Insights gives instance owners and admins visibility into how workflows perform over time. This feature consists of three parts:

- [**Insights summary banner**](#insights-summary-banner): Shows key metrics about your instance from the last 7 days at the top of the overview space.
- [**Insights dashboard**](#insights-dashboard): A more detailed visual breakdown with per-workflow metrics and historical comparisons.
- [**Time saved (Workflow ROI)**](#setting-the-time-saved-by-a-workflow): For each workflow, you can set the number of minutes of work that each production execution saves you.

The insights summary banner displays activity from the last 7 days for all plans. The insights dashboard is only available on Pro (with limited date ranges) and Enterprise plans.

## Insights summary banner

n8n collects several metrics for both the insights summary banner and dashboard. They include:

- Total production executions (not including sub-workflow executions or manual executions)
- Total failed production executions
- Production execution failure rate
- Time saved (when set on at least one or more active workflows)
- Run time average (including wait time from any wait nodes)

## Insights dashboard

Those on the Pro and Enterprise plans can access the **Insights** section from the side navigation. Each metric from the summary banner is also clickable, taking you to the corresponding chart.

The insights dashboard also has a table showing individual insights from each workflow including total production executions, failed production executions, failure rate, time saved, and run time average.

## Insights time periods

By default, the insights summary banner and dashboard show a rolling 7 day window with a comparison to the previous period to identify increases or decreases for each metric. On the dashboard, paid plans also display data for other date ranges:

- Pro: 7 and 14 days
- Enterprise: 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, 1 year

## Setting the time saved by a workflow

For each workflow, you can set the number of minutes of work a workflow saves you each time it runs. You can configure this by navigating to the workflow, selecting the three dots menu in the top right and selecting settings. There you can update the **Estimated time saved** value and save.

This setting helps you calculate how much time automating a process saves over time vs the manual effort to complete the same task or process. Once set, n8n calculates the amount of time the workflow saves you based on the number of production executions and displays it on the summary banner and dashboard.

## Disable or configure insights metrics collection

If you self-host n8n, you can disable or configure insights and metrics collection using [environment variables](../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/insights/).

### Which executions do n8n use to calculate the values in the insights banner and dashboard?

n8n insights only collects data from production executions (for example, those from active workflows triggered on a schedule or a webhook) from the main (parent) workflow. This means that it doesn't count manual (test) executions or executions from sub-workflows or error workflows.

### Does n8n use historic execution data when upgrading to a version with insights?

n8n only starts collecting data for insights once you update to the first supported version (1.89.0). This means it only reports on executions from that point forward and you won't see execution data in insights from prior periods.

## Item linking errors

**URL:** llms-txt#item-linking-errors

**Contents:**
  - Fix for 'Info for expressions missing from previous node'
  - Fix for 'Multiple matching items for expression'

In n8n you can reference data from any previous node. This doesn't have to be the node just before: it can be any previous node in the chain. When referencing nodes further back, you use the expression syntax `$(node_name).item`.

Diagram of threads for different items. Due to the item linking, you can get the actor for each movie using `$('Get famous movie actors').item`.

Since the previous node can have multiple items in it, n8n needs to know which one to use. When using `.item`, n8n figures this out for you behind the scenes. Refer to [Item linking concepts](../item-linking-concepts/) for detailed information on how this works.

`.item` fails if information is missing. To figure out which item to use, n8n maintains a thread back through the workflow's nodes for each item. For a given item, this thread tells n8n which items in previous nodes generated it. To find the matching item in a given previous node, n8n follows this thread back until it reaches the node in question.

When using `.item`, n8n displays an error when:

- The thread is broken
- The thread points to more than one item in the previous node (as it's unclear which one to use)

To solve these errors, you can either avoid using `.item`, or fix the root cause.

You can avoid `.item` by using `.first()`, `.last()` or `.all()[index]` instead. They require you to know the position of the item that you’re targeting within the target node's output items. Refer to [Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes](../../../../code/builtin/output-other-nodes/) for more detail on these methods.

The fix for the root cause depends on the exact error.

### Fix for 'Info for expressions missing from previous node'

If you see this error message:

> ERROR: Info for expression missing from previous node

There's a node in the chain that doesn't return pairing information. The solution here depends on the type of the previous node:

- Code nodes: make sure you return which input items the node used to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking in the code node](../item-linking-code-node/) for more information.
- Custom or community nodes: the node creator needs to update the node to return which input items it uses to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking for node creators](../item-linking-node-building/) for more information.

### Fix for 'Multiple matching items for expression'

This is the error message:

> ERROR: Multiple matching items for expression

Sometimes n8n uses multiple items to create a single item. Examples include the Summarize, Aggregate, and Merge nodes. These nodes can combine information from multiple items.

When you use `.item` and there are multiple possible matches, n8n doesn't know which one to use. To solve this you can either:

- Use `.first()`, `.last()` or `.all()[index]` instead. Refer to [Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes](../../../../code/builtin/output-other-nodes/) for more detail on these methods.
- Reference a different node that contains the same information, but doesn't have multiple matching items.

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

Some Microsoft services require extra information for OAuth2. Refer to [Service-specific settings](#service-specific-settings) for more guidance on those services.

For self-hosted users, there are two main steps to configure OAuth2 from scratch:

1. [Register an application](#register-an-application) with the Microsoft Identity Platform.
1. [Generate a client secret](#generate-a-client-secret) for that application.

Follow the detailed instructions for each step below. For more detail on the Microsoft OAuth2 web flow, refer to [Microsoft authentication and authorization basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts).

### Register an application

Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform:

1. Open the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://aka.ms/appregistrations).
1. Select **Register an application**.
1. Enter a **Name** for your app.
1. In **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Skype, Xbox)**.
1. In **Register an application**:
   1. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from your n8n credential.
   1. Paste it into the **Redirect URI (optional)** field.
   1. Select **Select a platform** > **Web**.
1. Select **Register** to finish creating your application.
1. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and paste it into n8n as the **Client ID**.

Refer to [Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2) for more information.

### Generate a client secret

With your application created, generate a client secret for it:

1. On your Microsoft application page, select **Certificates & secrets** in the left navigation.
1. In **Client secrets**, select **+ New client secret**.
1. Enter a **Description** for your client secret, such as `n8n credential`.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Copy the **Secret** in the **Value** column.
1. Paste it into n8n as the **Client Secret**.
1. If you see other fields in the n8n credential, refer to [Service-specific settings](#service-specific-settings) below for guidance on completing those fields.
1. Select **Connect my account** in n8n to finish setting up the connection.
1. Log in to your Microsoft account and allow the app to access your info.

Refer to Microsoft's [Add credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#add-credentials) for more information on adding a client secret.

### Service-specific settings

The following services require extra information for OAuth2:

Dynamics OAuth2 requires information about your Dynamics domain and region. Follow these extra steps to complete the credential:

1. Enter your Dynamics **Domain**.
1. Select the Dynamics data center **Region** you're within.

Refer to the [Microsoft Datacenter regions documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/new-datacenter-regions) for more information on the region options and corresponding URLs.

#### Microsoft (general)

The general Microsoft OAuth2 also requires you to provide a space-separated list of **Scope**s for this credential.

Refer to [Scopes and permissions in the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc) for a list of possible scopes.

Outlook OAuth2 supports the credential accessing a user's primary email inbox or a shared inbox. By default, the credential will access a user's primary email inbox. To change this behavior:

1. Turn on **Use Shared Inbox**.
1. Enter the target user's UPN or ID as the **User Principal Name**.

SharePoint OAuth2 requires information about your SharePoint **Subdomain**.

To complete the credential, enter the **Subdomain** part of your SharePoint URL. For example, if your SharePoint URL is `https://tenant123.sharepoint.com`, the subdomain is `tenant123`.

SharePoint requires the following permissions:

Application permissions:

- `Sites.Read.All`
- `Sites.ReadWrite.All`

Delegated permissions:

- `SearchConfiguration.Read.All`
- `SearchConfiguration.ReadWrite.All`

Here are the known common errors and issues with Microsoft OAuth2 credentials.

### Need admin approval

When attempting to add credentials for a Microsoft360 or Microsoft Entra account, users may see a message when following the procedure that this action requires admin approval.

This message will appear when the account attempting to grant permissions for the credential is managed by a Microsoft Entra. In order to issue the credential, the administrator account needs to grant permission to the user (or "tenant") for that application.

The procedure for this is covered in the [Microsoft Entra documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/grant-admin-consent).

Create a [Fortinet FortiGate](https://www.fortinet.com/) account.

## Supported authentication methods

Refer to [Fortinet FortiGate's API documentation](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.4.3/administration-guide/940602/using-apis) for more information about the service.

This is a credential-only node. Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) to learn more. View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/fortinet-fortigate/) on n8n's website.

## Using API access token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An API **Access Token**: To generate an access token, create a [REST API administrator](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.4.3/administration-guide/399023/rest-api-administrator).

Refer to the [Fortinet FortiGate Using APIs documentation](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/7.4.3/administration-guide/940602/using-apis) for more information about token-based authentication in FortiGate.

## Summarize

**URL:** llms-txt#summarize

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Fields to Summarize
  - Fields to Split By
- Node options
  - Continue if Field Not Found
  - Disable Dot Notation
  - Output Format
- Ignore items without valid fields to group by
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

Use the Summarize node to aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

### Fields to Summarize

Use these fields to define how you want to summarize your input data.

- **Aggregation**: Select the aggregation method to use on a given field. Options include:
  - **Append**: Append
    - If you select this option, decide whether you want to **Include Empty Values** or not.
  - **Average**: Calculate the numeric average of your input data.
  - **Concatenate**: Combine together values in your input data.
    - If you select this option, decide whether you want to **Include Empty Values** or not.
    - **Separator**: Select the separator you want to insert between concatenated values.
  - **Count**: Count the total number of values in your input data.
  - **Count Unique**: Count the number of unique values in your input data.
  - **Max**: Find the highest numeric value in your input data.
  - **Min**: Find the lowest numeric value in your input data.
  - **Sum**: Add together the numeric values in your input data.
- **Field**: Enter the name of the field you want to perform the aggregation on.

### Fields to Split By

Enter the name of the input fields that you want to split the summary by (similar to a group by statement). This allows you to get separate summaries based on values in other fields.

For example, if our input data contains columns for `Sales Rep` and `Deal Amount` and we're performing a **Sum** on the `Deal Amount` field, we could split by `Sales Rep` to get a **Sum** total for each Sales Rep.

To enter multiple fields to split by, enter a comma-separated list.

### Continue if Field Not Found

By default, if a **Field to Summarize** isn't in any items, the node throws an error. Use this option to continue and return a single empty item (turned on) instead or keep the default error behavior (turned off).

### Disable Dot Notation

By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).

Select the format for your output format. This option is recommended if you're using **Fields to Split By**

- **Each Split in a Separate Item**: Use this option to generate a separate output item for each split out field.
- **All Splits in a Single Item**: Use this option to generate a single item that lists the split out fields.

## Ignore items without valid fields to group by

Set whether to ignore input items that don't contain the **Fields to Split By** (turned on) or not (turned off).

## Configuration

**URL:** llms-txt#configuration

**Contents:**
- Set environment variables by command line
  - npm
  - Docker
- Docker Compose file
- Keeping sensitive data in separate files

You can change n8n's settings using environment variables. For a full list of available configurations see [Environment Variables](../environment-variables/).

## Set environment variables by command line

For npm, set your desired environment variables in terminal. The command depends on your command line.

In Docker you can use the `-e` flag from the command line:

## Docker Compose file

In Docker, you can set your environment variables in the `n8n: environment:` element of your `docker-compose.yaml` file.

## Keeping sensitive data in separate files

You can append `_FILE` to individual environment variables to provide their configuration in a separate file, enabling you to avoid passing sensitive details using environment variables. n8n loads the data from the file with the given name, making it possible to load data from [Docker-Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/) and [Kubernetes-Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

Refer to [Environment variables](../environment-variables/) for details on each variable.

While most environment variables can use the `_FILE` suffix, it's more beneficial for sensitive data such as [credentials](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n) and database configuration. Here are some examples:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
export <variable>=<value>
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
set <variable>=<value>
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
$env:<variable>=<value>
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED="false" \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

Notable new features.

#### Resource mapper UI component

This release includes a new UI component, the resource mapper. This component is useful for node creators. If your node does insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. Often it's necessary to use a Set node before a node that sends data, to get the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node.

Refer to [Node user interface elements | Resource mapper](../../integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/#resource-mapper) for guidance for node builders.

**Release date:** 2022-07-20

This release includes several major new features, including:

- The community nodes repository: a new way to build and share nodes.
- Data pinning and data mapping: accelerate workflow development with better data manipulation functionality.

#### Community nodes repository

This release introduces the [community node repository](../../integrations/community-nodes/installation/). This allows developers to build and share nodes as npm packages. Users can install community-built nodes directly in n8n.

[Data pinning](../../data/data-pinning/) allows you to freeze and edit data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions. This avoids repeated API calls when developing a workflow, reducing calls to external systems, and speeding up workflow development.

This release introduces a drag and drop interface for [data mapping](../../data/data-mapping/), as a quick way to map data without using expressions.

#### Simplify authentication setup for node creators

This release introduces a simpler way of handling authorization when building a node. All credentials should now contain an `authenticate` property that dictates how the credential is used in a request. n8n has also simplified authentication types: instead of specifying an authentication type and using the correct interface, you can now set the type as `"generic"`, and use the `IAuthenticateGeneric` interface.

You can use this approach for any authentication method where data is sent in the header, body, or query string. This includes methods like bearer and basic auth. You can't use this approach for more complex authentication types that require multiple calls, or for methods that don't pass authentication data. This includes OAuth.

For an example of the new authentication syntax, refer to n8n's [Asana node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/credentials/AsanaApi.credentials.ts).

#### Other new features

- Added a `preAuthentication` method to credentials.
- Added more credentials tests.
- Introduce automatic fixing for paired item information in some scenarios.

### Node enhancements

- [ERPNext node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.erpnext/): add credential tests, and add support for unauthorized certs.

**Release date:** 2022-05-24

This is a bug fix release. It solves an issue with setting credentials in the HTTP Request node.

View the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.177.0...n8n@0.178.0) for this version.\
**Release date:** 2022-05-24

This release adds support for reusing existing credentials in the HTTP Request node, making it easier to do custom operation with APIs where n8n already has an integration.

The release also includes improvements to the nodes view, giving better detail about incoming data, as well as some bug fixes.

#### Credential reuse for custom API operations

n8n supplies hundreds of nodes, allowing you to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the HTTP Request node.

One of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. To simplify this, n8n now provides a way to use existential credential types (credentials associated with n8n nodes) in the HTTP Request node.

For more information, refer to [Custom API operations](../../integrations/custom-operations/).

#### Node details view

An improved node view, showing more detail about node inputs.

### Node enhancements

[Salesforce Node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.salesforce/): Add the **Country** field.

- **Editor UI**: don't display the dividing line unless necessary.

Fixes a bug in the editor UI related to node versioning.

View the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.174.0...n8n@0.175.0) for this version.\
**Release date:** 2022-05-02

This release adds support for node versioning, along with node enhancements and bug fixes.

0.175.0 adds support for a lightweight method of node versioning. One node can contain multiple versions, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature, change the `version` parameter in your node to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version. You can then access the version parameter with `@version` in your `displayOptions` (to control which version n8n displays). You can also query the version in your `execute` function using `const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;`.

- [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/): a query language for JSON

You can use Luxon and JMESPath in the code editor and in expressions.

#### New expressions variables

We've added two new variables to simplify working with date and time in expressions:

- `$now`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to DateTime.now().
- `$today`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).

#### Negative operations in If and Switch nodes

Made it easier to perform negative operations on strings.

This release adds one new operation for numbers:

And the following new operations for strings:

## For example "Today's date is 1646834498755"

**URL:** llms-txt#for-example-"today's-date-is-1646834498755"

**Contents:**
  - Convert JavaScript dates to Luxon
  - Convert date string to Luxon
  - Get n days from today
  - Create human-readable dates
  - Get the time between two dates
  - A longer example: How many days to Christmas?

{{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')}}

let luxonDateTime = DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')

{{DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")}}

let newFormat = DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")

{{$today.minus({days: 7})}}

let sevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7})

{{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()}}

let readableSevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()

{{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})}}

let readableSevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})

{{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()}}

let monthsBetweenDates = DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()

{{"There are " + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + " days to Christmas!"}}

let daysToChristmas = "There are " + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + " days to Christmas!";
```

This outputs `"There are <number of days> days to Christmas!"`. For example, on 9th March, it outputs "There are 291 days to Christmas!".

A detailed explanation of what the code does:

- `"There are "`: a string.
- `+`: used to join two strings.
- `$today.diff()`: This is similar to the example in [Get the time between two dates](#get-the-time-between-two-dates), but it uses n8n's custom `$today` variable.
- `DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days'`: this part gets the current year using `$today.year`, turns it into an ISO string along with the month and date, and then takes the whole ISO string and converts it to a Luxon DateTime data structure. It also tells Luxon that you want the duration in days.
- `toObject()` turns the result of diff() into a more usable object. At this point, the expression returns `[Object: {"days":-<number-of-days>}]`. For example, on 9th March, `[Object: {"days":-291}]`.
- `.days` uses JMESPath syntax to retrieve just the number of days from the object. For more information on using JMESPath with n8n, refer to our [JMESpath](../jmespath/) documentation. This gives you the number of days to Christmas, as a negative number.
- `.toString().substring(1)` turns the number into a string and removes the `-`.
- `+ " days to Christmas!"`: another string, with a `+` to join it to the previous string.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
n8n provides built-in convenience functions to support data transformation in expressions for dates. Refer to [Data transformation functions | Dates](../../builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/) for more information.

### Convert JavaScript dates to Luxon

To convert a native JavaScript date to a Luxon date:

- In expressions, use the [`.toDateTime()` method](../../builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/#date-toDateTime). For example, `{{ (new Date()).ToDateTime() }}`.
- In the Code node, use `DateTime.fromJSDate()`. For example, `let luxondate = DateTime.fromJSDate(new Date())`.

### Convert date string to Luxon

You can convert date strings and other date formats to a Luxon DateTime object. You can convert from standard formats and from arbitrary strings.

A difference between Luxon DateTime and JavaScript Date

With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with `new Date('2019-06-23')`. In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as `DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23')` or `DateTime.fromFormat("23-06-2019", "dd-MM-yyyy")`.

#### If you have a date in a supported standard technical format:

Most dates use `fromISO()`. This creates a Luxon DateTime from an ISO 8601 string. For example:
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown

```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
Luxon's API documentation has more information on [fromISO](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimefromiso).

Luxon provides functions to handle conversions for a range of formats. Refer to Luxon's guide to [Parsing technical formats](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=parsing-technical-formats) for details.

#### If you have a date as a string that doesn't use a standard format:

Use Luxon's [Ad-hoc parsing](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=ad-hoc-parsing). To do this, use the `fromFormat()` function, providing the string and a set of [tokens](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=table-of-tokens) that describe the format.

For example, you have n8n's founding date, 23rd June 2019, formatted as `23-06-2019`. You want to turn this into a Luxon object:
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown

```

For general LDAP information, refer to [Basic LDAP concepts](https://ldap.com/basic-ldap-concepts/) for a basic overview and [The LDAP Bind Operation](https://ldap.com/the-ldap-bind-operation/) for information on how the bind operation and authentication work.

## Using LDAP server details

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The **LDAP Server Address**: Use the IP address or domain of your LDAP server.
- The **LDAP Server Port**: Use the number of the port used to connect to the LDAP server.
- The **Binding DN**: Use the Binding Distinguished Name (Bind DN) for your LDAP server. This is the user account the credential should log in as. If you're using Active Directory, this may look something like `cn=administrator, cn=Users, dc=n8n, dc=io`. Refer to your LDAP provider's documentation for more information on identifying this DN and the related password.
- The **Binding Password**: Use the password for the **Binding DN** user.
- Select the **Connection Security**: Options include:
  - `None`
  - `TLS`
  - `STARTTLS`
- *Optional:* Enter a numeric value in seconds to set a **Connection Timeout**.

## XML

**URL:** llms-txt#xml

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
- Node options
  - JSON to XML options
  - XML to JSON options
- Templates and examples

Use the XML node to convert data from and to XML.

If your XML is within a binary file, use the [Extract from File](../n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) node to convert it to text first.

- **Mode**: The format the data should be converted from and to.
  - **JSON to XML**: Converts data from JSON to XML.
  - **XML to JSON**: Converts data from XML to JSON.
- **Property Name**: Enter the name of the property which contains the data to convert.

These options are available regardless of the **Mode** you select:

- **Attribute Key**: Enter the prefix used to access the attributes. Default is `$`.
- **Character Key**: Enter the prefix used to access the character content. Default is `_`.

All other options depend on the selected **Mode**.

### JSON to XML options

These options only appear if you select **JSON to XML** as the **Mode**:

- **Allow Surrogate Chars**: Set whether to allow using characters from the Unicode surrogate blocks (turned on) or not (turned off).
- **Cdata**: Set whether to wrap text nodes in `<![CDATA[ ... ]]>` instead of escaping when it's required (turned on) or not (turned off).
  - Turning this option on doesn't add `<![CDATA[ ... ]]>` if it's not required.
- **Headless**: Set whether to omit the XML header (turned on) or include it (turned off).
- **Root Name**: Enter the root element name to use.

### XML to JSON options

These options only appear if you select **XML to JSON** as the **Mode**:

- **Explicit Array**: Set whether to put child nodes in an array (turned on) or create an array only if there's more than one child node (turned off).
- **Explicit Root**: Set whether to get the root node in the resulting object (turned on) or not (turned off).
- **Ignore Attributes**: Set whether to ignore all XML attributes and only create text nodes (turned on) or not (turned off).
- **Merge Attributes**: Set whether to merge attributes and child elements as properties of the parent (turned on) or key attributes off a child attribute object (turned off). This option is ignored if **Ignore Attribute** is turned on.
- **Normalize**: Set whether to trim whitespaces inside the text nodes (turned on) or not to trim them (turned off).
- **Normalize Tags**: Set whether to normalize all tag names to lowercase (turned on) or keep tag names as-is (turned off).
- **Trim**: Set whether to trim the whitespace at the beginning and end of text nodes (turned on) or to leave the whitespace as-is (turned off).

Proprietary licenses for Enterprise

Proprietary licenses are available for enterprise customers. [Get in touch](mailto:license@n8n.io) for more information.

n8n's [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md) are based on the [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) model.

### What license do you use?

n8n uses the [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md). These licenses are based on the [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) model.

### What source code is covered by the Sustainable Use License?

The [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) applies to all our source code hosted in our [main GitHub repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) except:

- Content of branches other than master.
- Source code files that contain `.ee.` in their file name. These are licensed under the [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md).

### What is the Sustainable Use License?

The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code software license created by n8n in 2022. You can read more about why we did this [here](#why-did-you-create-a-license). The license allows you the free right to use, modify, create derivative works, and redistribute, with three limitations:

- You may use or modify the software only for your own internal business purposes or for non-commercial or personal use.
- You may distribute the software or provide it to others only if you do so free of charge for non-commercial purposes.
- You may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices of the licensor in the software. Any use of the licensor's trademarks is subject to applicable law.

We encourage anyone who wants to use the Sustainable Use License. If you are building something out in the open, it makes sense to think about licensing earlier in order to avoid problems later. Contact us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io) if you would like to ask any questions about it.

### What is and isn't allowed under the license in the context of n8n's product?

Our license restricts use to "internal business purposes". In practice this means all use is allowed unless you are selling a product, service, or module in which the value derives entirely or substantially from n8n functionality. Here are some examples that wouldn't be allowed:

- White-labeling n8n and offering it to your customers for money.
- Hosting n8n and charging people money to access it.

All of the following examples are allowed under our license:

- Using n8n to sync the data you control as a company, for example from a CRM to an internal database.
- Creating an n8n node for your product or any other integration between your product and n8n.
- Providing consulting services related to n8n, for example building workflows, custom features closely connect to n8n, or code that gets executed by n8n.
- Supporting n8n, for example by setting it up or maintaining it on an internal company server.

#### Can I use n8n to act as the back-end to power a feature in my app?

Usually yes, as long as the back-end process doesn't use users' own credentials to access their data.

Here are two examples to clarify:

##### Example 1: Sync ACME app with HubSpot

Bob sets up n8n to collect a user's HubSpot credentials to sync data in the ACME app with data in HubSpot.

**NOT ALLOWED** under the Sustainable Use License. This use case collects the user's own HubSpot credentials to pull information to feed into the ACME app.

##### Example 2: Embed AI chatbot in ACME app

Bob sets up n8n to embed an AI chatbot within the ACME app. The AI chatbot's credentials in n8n use Bob's company credentials. ACME app end-users only enter their questions or queries to the chatbot.

**ALLOWED** under the Sustainable Use License. No user credentials are being collected.

### What if I want to use n8n for something that's not permitted by the license?

You must sign a separate commercial agreement with us. We actively encourage software creators to embed n8n within their products; we just ask them to sign an agreement laying out the terms of use, and the fees owed to n8n for using the product in this way. We call this mode of use n8n Embed. You can learn more, and contact us about it [here](https://n8n.io/embed).

If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at [the examples](#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product), and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### Why don't you use an open source license?

n8n's mission is to give everyone who uses a computer technical superpowers. We've decided the best way for us to achieve this mission is to make n8n as widely and freely available as possible for users, while ensuring we can build a sustainable, viable business. By making our product free to use, easy to distribute, and source-available we help everyone access the product. By operating as a business, we can continue to release features, fix bugs, and provide reliable software at scale long-term.

### Why did you create a license?

Creating a license was our least favorite option. We only went down this path after reviewing the possible existing licenses and deciding nothing fit our specific needs. There are two ways in which we try to mitigate the pain and friction of using a proprietary license:

1. By using plain English, and keeping it as short as possible.
1. By promoting [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) with the goal of making it a well-known umbrella term to describe software models like ours.

Our goals when we created the Sustainable Use License were:

1. To be as permissive as possible.
1. Safeguarding our ability to build a business.
1. Being as clear as possible what use was permitted or not.

### My company has a policy against using code that restricts commercial use – can I still use n8n?

Provided you are using n8n for internal business purposes, and not making n8n available to your customers for them to connect their accounts and build workflows, you should be able to use n8n. If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at [the examples](#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product), and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### What happens to the code I contribute to n8n in light of the Sustainable Use License?

Any code you contribute on GitHub is subject to GitHub's [terms of use](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#d-user-generated-content). In simple terms, this means you own, and are responsible for, anything you contribute, but that you grant other GitHub users certain rights to use this code. When you contribute code to a repository containing notice of a license, you license the code under the same terms.

n8n asks every contributor to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md). In addition to the above, this gives n8n the ability to change its license without seeking additional permission. It also means you aren't liable for your contributions (e.g. in case they cause damage to someone else's business).

It's easy to get started contributing code to n8n [here](https://github.com/n8n-io), and we've listed broader ways of participating in our community [here](../help-community/contributing/).

### Why did you switch to the Sustainable Use License from your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?

n8n was licensed under Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause until 17 March 2022. Commons Clause was initiated by various software companies wanting to protect their rights against cloud providers. The concept involved adding a commercial restriction on top of an existing open source license.

However, the use of the Commons Clause as an additional condition to an open source license, as well as the use of wording that's open to interpretation, created some confusion and uncertainty regarding the terms of use. The Commons Clause also restricted people's ability to offer consulting and support services: we realized these services are critical in enabling people to get value from n8n, so we wanted to remove this restriction.

We created the Sustainable Use License to be more permissive and more clear about what use is allowed, while continuing to ensure n8n gets the funding needed to build and improve our product.

### What are the main differences between the Sustainable Use License and your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?

There are two main differences between the Sustainable Use License and our previous license arrangement. The first is that we have tightened the definition of how you can use the software. Previously the Commons Clause restricted users ability to "sell" the software; we have redefined this to restrict use to internal business purposes. The second difference is that our previous license restricted people's ability to charge fees for consulting or support services related to the software: we have lifted that restriction altogether.

That means you are now free to offer commercial consulting or support services (e.g. building n8n workflows) without the need for a separate license agreement with us. If you are interested in joining our community of n8n experts providing these services, you can learn more here.

### Is n8n open source?

Although n8n's source code is available under the Sustainable Use License, according to the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) (OSI), open source licenses can't include limitations on use, so we do not call ourselves open source. In practice, n8n offers most users many of the same benefits as OSI-approved open source.

We coined the term ['fair-code'](https://faircode.io/) as a way of describing our licensing model, and the model of other companies who are source-available, but restrict commercial use of their source code.

### What is fair-code, and how does the Sustainable Use License relate to it?

Fair-code isn't a software license. It describes a software model where software:

- Is generally free to use and can be distributed by anybody.
- Has its source code openly available.
- Can be extended by anybody in public and private communities.
- Is commercially restricted by its authors.

The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code license. You can read more about it and see other examples of fair-code licenses [here](https://faircode.io/).

We're always excited to talk about software licenses, fair-code, and other principles around sharing code with interested parties. To get in touch to chat, email [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

### Can I use n8n's Sustainable Use License for my own project?

Yes! We're excited to see more software use the Sustainable Use License. We'd love to hear about your project if you're using our license: [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).

## Common issues and questions

**URL:** llms-txt#common-issues-and-questions

**Contents:**
- Listen for multiple HTTP methods
- Use the HTTP Request node to trigger the Webhook node
- Use curl to trigger the Webhook node
- Send a response of type string
- Test URL versus Production URL
- IP addresses in whitelist are failing to connect
- Only one webhook per path and method
- Timeouts on n8n Cloud

Here are some common issues and questions for the [Webhook node](../) and suggested solutions.

## Listen for multiple HTTP methods

By default, the Webhook node accepts calls that use a single method. For example, it can accept GET or POST requests, but not both. If you want to accept calls using multiple methods:

1. Open the node **Settings**.
1. Turn on **Allow Multiple HTTP Methods**.
1. Return to **Parameters**. By default, the node now accepts GET and POST calls. You can add other methods in the **HTTP Methods** field.

The Webhook node has an output for each method, so you can perform different actions depending on the method.

## Use the HTTP Request node to trigger the Webhook node

The [HTTP Request](../../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node makes HTTP requests to the URL you specify.

1. Create a new workflow.
1. Add the HTTP Request node to the workflow.
1. Select a method from the **Request Method** dropdown list. For example, if you select GET as the **HTTP method** in your Webhook node, select GET as the request method in the HTTP Request node.
1. Copy the URL from the Webhook node, and paste it in the **URL** field in the HTTP Request node.
1. If using the test URL for the webhook node: execute the workflow with the Webhook node.
1. Execute the HTTP Request node.

## Use curl to trigger the Webhook node

You can use [curl](https://curl.se/) to make HTTP requests that trigger the Webhook node.

In the examples, replace `<https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>` with your webhook URL.\
The examples make GET requests. You can use whichever HTTP method you set in **HTTP Method**.

Make an HTTP request without any parameters:

Make an HTTP request with a body parameter:

Make an HTTP request with header parameter:

Make an HTTP request to send a file:

Replace `/path/to/file` with the path of the file you want to send.

## Send a response of type string

By default, the response format is JSON or an array. To send a response of type string:

1. Select **Response Mode** > **When Last Node Finishes**.
1. Select **Response Data** > **First Entry JSON**.
1. Select **Add Option** > **Property Name**.
1. Enter the name of the property that contains the response. This defaults to `data`.
1. Connect an [Edit Fields node](../../n8n-nodes-base.set/) to the Webhook node.
1. In the Edit Fields node, select **Add Value** > **String**.
1. Enter the name of the property in the **Name** field. The name should match the property name from step 4.
1. Enter the string value in the **Value** field.
1. Toggle **Keep Only Set** to on (green).

When you call the Webhook, it sends the string response from the Edit Fields node.

## Test URL versus Production URL

n8n generates two **Webhook URLs** for each Webhook node: a **Test URL** and a **Production URL**.

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL**. Once you're ready to use your Webhook URL in production, use the **Production URL**.

| **URL type**   | **How to trigger**                                                         | **Listening duration**     | **Data shown in editor UI?** |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Test URL       | Select **Listen for test event** and trigger a test event from the source. | 120 seconds                |                              |
| Production URL | Activate the workflow                                                      | Until workflow deactivated |                              |

Refer to [Workflow development](../workflow-development/) for more information.

## IP addresses in whitelist are failing to connect

If you're unable to connect from IP addresses in your IP whitelist, check if you are running n8n behind a reverse proxy.

If so, set the `N8N_PROXY_HOPS` [environment variable](../../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) to the number of reverse-proxies n8n is running behind.

## Only one webhook per path and method

n8n only permits registering one webhook for each path and HTTP method combination (for example, a `GET` request for `/my-request`). This avoids ambiguity over which webhook should receive requests.

If you receive a message that the path and method you chose are already in use, you can either:

- Deactivate the workflow with the conflicting webhook.
- Change the webhook path and/or method for one of the conflicting webhooks.

## Timeouts on n8n Cloud

n8n Cloud uses Cloudflare to protect against malicious traffic. If your webhook doesn't respond within 100 seconds, the incoming request will fail with a [524 status code](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/cloudflare-5xx-errors/error-524/).

Because of this, for long-running processes that might exceed this limit, you may need to introduce polling logic by configuring two separate webhooks:

- One webhook to start the long-running process and send an immediate response.
- A second webhook that you can call at intervals to query the status of the process and retrieve the result once it's complete.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --data 'key=value'
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --header 'key=value'
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --from 'key=@/path/to/file'
```

## TheHive 5 credentials

**URL:** llms-txt#thehive-5-credentials

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Supported authentication methods
- Related resources
- Using API key

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes with TheHive 5.

- [TheHive 5](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.thehive5/)

TheHive and TheHive 5

n8n provides two nodes for TheHive. Use these credentials with TheHive 5 node. If you're using TheHive node for TheHive 3 or TheHive 4, use [TheHive credentials](../thehive/).

Install [TheHive 5](https://docs.strangebee.com/thehive/download/) on your server.

## Supported authentication methods

Refer to [TheHive's API documentation](https://docs.strangebee.com/thehive/api-docs/) for more information about the service.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Key**: Users with `orgAdmin` and `superAdmin` accounts can generate API keys:
  - `orgAdmin` account: Go to **Organization > Create API Key** for the user you wish to generate a key for.
  - `superAdmin` account: Go to **Users > Create API Key** for the user you wish to generate a key for.
  - Refer to [API Authentication](https://docs.strangebee.com/cortex/api/api-guide/?h=api+key#authentication) for more information.
- A **URL**: The URL of your TheHive server.
- **Ignore SSL Issues**: When turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.

**Contents:**

  - Command
- Templates and examples
- Common issues

The Execute Command node runs shell commands on the host machine that runs n8n.

Security considerations

The Execute Command node can introduce significant security risks in environments that operate with untrusted users. Because of this, n8n recommends [disabling](../../../../hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/#exclude-nodes) it in such setups.

Which shell runs the command?

This node executes the command in the default shell of the host machine. For example, `cmd` on Windows and `zsh` on macOS.

If you run n8n with Docker, your command will run in the n8n container and not the Docker host.

If you're using [queue mode](../../../../hosting/scaling/queue-mode/), the command runs on the worker that's executing the task in production mode. When running manual executions, it runs on the main instance, unless you set `OFFLOAD_MANUAL_EXECUTIONS_TO_WORKERS` to `true`.

Not available on Cloud

This node isn't available on n8n Cloud.

Configure the node using the following parameters.

Choose whether you want the node to execute only once (turned on) or once for every item it receives as input (turned off).

Enter the command to execute on the host machine. Refer to sections below for examples of running [multiple commands](#run-multiple-commands) and [cURL commands](#run-curl-command).

#### Run multiple commands

Use one of two methods to run multiple commands in one Execute Command node:

- Enter each command on one line separated by `&&`. For example, you can combine the change directory (cd) command with the list (ls) command using `&&`.

- Enter each command on a separate line. For example, you can write the list (ls) command on a new line after the change directory (cd) command.

#### Run cURL command

You can also use the [HTTP Request](../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node to make a cURL request.

If you want to run the curl command in the Execute Command node, you will have to build a Docker image based on the existing n8n image. The default n8n Docker image uses Alpine Linux. You will have to install the curl package.

1. Create a file named `Dockerfile`.

1. Add the below code snippet to the Dockerfile.

1. In the same folder, execute the command below to build the Docker image.

1. Replace the Docker image you used before. For example, replace `docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n` with `n8n-curl`.

1. Run the newly created Docker image. You'll now be able to execute ssh using the Execute Command Node.

Use the Merge node to combine data from multiple streams, once data of all streams is available.

Major changes in 0.194.0

The n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 0.194.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/4ff688642cc9ee7ca7d00987847bf4e4515da59d/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge.md).

Minor changes in 1.49.0

n8n version 1.49.0 introduced the option to add more than two inputs. Older versions only support up to two inputs. If you're running an older version and want to combine multiple inputs in these versions, use the [Code node](https://deploy-preview-2225--n8n-docs.netlify.app/code/code-node/).

The **Mode > SQL Query** feature was also added in n8n version 1.49.0 and isn't available in older versions.

You can specify how the Merge node should combine data from different data streams by choosing a **Mode**:

Keep data from all inputs. Choose a **Number of Inputs** to output items of each input, one after another. The node waits for the execution of all connected inputs.

Append mode inputs and output

Combine data from two inputs. Select an option in **Combine By** to determine how you want to merge the input data.

Compare items by field values. Enter the fields you want to compare in **Fields to Match**.

n8n's default behavior is to keep matching items. You can change this using the **Output Type** setting:

- **Keep Matches**: Merge items that match. This is like an inner join.
- **Keep Non-Matches**: Merge items that don't match.
- **Keep Everything**: Merge items together that do match and include items that don't match. This is like an outer join.
- **Enrich Input 1**: Keep all data from Input 1, and add matching data from Input 2. This is like a left join.
- **Enrich Input 2**: Keep all data from Input 2, and add matching data from Input 1. This is like a right join.

Combine by Matching Fields mode inputs and output

Combine items based on their order. The item at index 0 in Input 1 merges with the item at index 0 in Input 2, and so on.

Combine by Position mode inputs and output

#### All Possible Combinations

Output all possible item combinations, while merging fields with the same name.

Combine by All Possible Combinations mode inputs and output

#### Combine mode options

When merging data by **Mode > Combine**, you can set these **Options**:

- **Clash Handling**: Choose how to merge when data streams clash, or when there are sub-fields. Refer to [Clash handling](#clash-handling) for details.
- **Fuzzy Compare**: Whether to tolerate type differences when comparing fields (enabled), or not (disabled, default). For example, when you enable this, n8n treats `"3"` and `3` as the same.
- **Disable Dot Notation**: This prevents accessing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name.
- **Multiple Matches**: Choose how n8n handles multiple matches when comparing data streams.
  - **Include All Matches**: Output multiple items if there are multiple matches, one for each match.
  - **Include First Match Only**: Keep the first item per match and discard the remaining multiple matches.
- **Include Any Unpaired Items**: Choose whether to keep or discard unpaired items when merging by position. The default behavior is to leave out the items without a match.

If multiple items at an index have a field with the same name, this is a clash. For example, if all items in both Input 1 and Input 2 have a field named `language`, these fields clash. By default, n8n prioritizes Input 2, meaning if `language` has a value in Input 2, n8n uses that value when merging the items.

You can change this behavior by selecting **Options** > **Clash Handling**:

- **When Field Values Clash**: Choose which input to prioritize, or choose **Always Add Input Number to Field Names** to keep all fields and values, with the input number appended to the field name to show which input it came from.
- **Merging Nested Fields**
  - **Deep Merge**: Merge properties at all levels of the items, including nested objects. This is useful when dealing with complex, nested data structures where you need to ensure the merging of all levels of nested properties.
  - **Shallow Merge**: Merge properties at the top level of the items only, without merging nested objects. This is useful when you have flat data structures or when you only need to merge top-level properties without worrying about nested properties.

Write a custom SQL Query to merge the data.

Data from previous nodes are available as tables and you can use them in the SQL query as input1, input2, input3, and so on, based on their order. Refer to [AlaSQL GitHub page](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Supported-SQL-statements) for a full list of supported SQL statements.

Choose which input to keep. This option always waits until the data from both inputs is available. You can choose to **Output**:

- The **Input 1 Data**
- The **Input 2 Data**
- **A Single, Empty Item**

The node outputs the data from the chosen input, without changing it.

## Merging data streams with uneven numbers of items

The items passed into Input 1 of the Merge node will take precedence. For example, if the Merge node receives five items in Input 1 and 10 items in Input 2, it only processes five items. The remaining five items from Input 2 aren't processed.

## Branch execution with If and Merge nodes

n8n removed this execution behavior in version 1.0. This section applies to workflows using the **v0 (legacy)** workflow execution order. By default, this is all workflows built before version 1.0. You can change the execution order in your [workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/).

If you add a Merge node to a workflow containing an If node, it can result in both output data streams of the If node executing.

One data stream triggers the Merge node, which then goes and executes the other data stream.

For example, in the screenshot below there's a workflow containing an Edit Fields node, If node, and Merge node. The standard If node behavior is to execute one data stream (in the screenshot, this is the **true** output). However, due to the Merge node, both data streams execute, despite the If node not sending any data down the **false** data stream.

## Try it out: A step by step example

Create a workflow with some example input data to try out the Merge node.

### Set up sample data using the Code nodes

1. Add a Code node to the canvas and connect it to the Start node.

1. Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript Code** field:

1. Add a second Code node, and connect it to the Start node.

1. Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript Code** field:

### Try out different merge modes

Add the Merge node. Connect the first Code node to **Input 1**, and the second Code node to **Input 2**. Run the workflow to load data into the Merge node.

The final workflow should look like this:

[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/655-merge-greetings-with-the-users-based-on-the-language/)

Now try different options in **Mode** to see how it affects the output data.

Select **Mode** > **Append**, then select **Execute step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Stefan   | de           |              |
| Jim      | en           |              |
| Hans     | de           |              |
|          | en           | Hello        |
|          | de           | Hallo        |

#### Combine by Matching Fields

You can merge these two data inputs so that each person gets the correct greeting for their language.

1. Select **Mode** > **Combine**.
1. Select **Combine by** > **Matching Fields**.
1. In both **Input 1 Field** and **Input 2 Field**, enter `language`. This tells n8n to combine the data by matching the values in the `language` field in each data set.
1. Select **Execute step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Stefan   | de           | Hallo        |
| Jim      | en           | Hello        |
| Hans     | de           | Hallo        |

#### Combine by Position

Select **Mode** > **Combine**, **Combine by** > **Position**, then select **Execute step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Stefan   | en           | Hello        |
| Jim      | de           | Hallo        |

##### Keep unpaired items

If you want to keep all items, select **Add Option** > **Include Any Unpaired Items**, then turn on **Include Any Unpaired Items**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Stefan   | en           | Hello        |
| Jim      | de           | Hallo        |
| Hans     | de           |              |

#### Combine by All Possible Combinations

Select **Mode** > **Combine**, **Combine by** > **All Possible Combinations**, then select **Execute step**.

Your output in table view should look like this:

| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Stefan   | en           | Hello        |
| Stefan   | de           | Hallo        |
| Jim      | en           | Hello        |
| Jim      | de           | Hallo        |
| Hans     | en           | Hello        |

- [**Download**](#download) a file
- [**List**](#list) folder content
- [**Rename**](#rename) or move a file or folder
- [**Upload**](#upload) a file

To attach a file for upload, you'll need to use an extra node such as the [Read/Write Files from Disk](../n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) node or the [HTTP Request](../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node to pass the file as a data property.

This operation includes one parameter: **Path**. Enter the remote path that you would like to connect to.

The delete operation adds one new option: **Folder**. If you turn this option on, the node can delete both folders and files. This configuration also displays one more option:

- **Recursive**: If you turn this option on and you delete a folder or directory, the node will delete all files and directories within the target directory.

Configure this operation with these parameters:

- **Path**: Enter the remote path that you would like to connect to.
- **Put Output File in Field**: Enter the name of the output binary field to put the file in.

Concurrent Reads with SFTP

When using SFTP, you can enable concurrent reads. This improves download speeds but may not be supported by all SFTP servers.

## Monitoring

**URL:** llms-txt#monitoring

**Contents:**
- healthz and healthz/readiness
- metrics
- Enable metrics and healthz for self-hosted n8n

There are three API endpoints you can call to check the status of your instance: `/healthz`, `healthz/readiness`, and `/metrics`.

## healthz and healthz/readiness

The `/healthz` endpoint returns a standard HTTP status code. 200 indicates the instance is reachable. It doesn't indicate DB status. It's available for both self-hosted and Cloud users.

The `/healthz/readiness` endpoint is similar to the `/healthz` endpoint, but it returns a HTTP status code of 200 if the DB is connected and migrated and therefore the instance is ready to accept traffic.

The `/metrics` endpoint provides more detailed information about the current status of the instance.

The `/metrics` endpoint isn't available on n8n Cloud.

## Enable metrics and healthz for self-hosted n8n

The `/metrics` and `/healthz` endpoints are disabled by default. To enable them, configure your n8n instance:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
<your-instance-url>/healthz
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
<your-instance-url>/healthz/readiness
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
<your-instance-url>/metrics
```

## Two-factor authentication (2FA)

**URL:** llms-txt#two-factor-authentication-(2fa)

**Contents:**
- Enable 2FA
- Disable 2FA for your instance

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second authentication method on top of username and password. This increases account security. n8n supports 2FA using an authenticator app.

You need an authenticator app on your phone.

To enable 2FA in n8n:

1. Go to you **Settings** > **Personal**.
1. Select **Enable 2FA**. n8n opens a modal with a QR code.
1. Scan the QR code in your authenticator app.
1. Enter the code from your app in **Code from authenticator app**.
1. Select **Continue**. n8n displays recovery codes.
1. Save the recovery codes. You need these to regain access to your account if you lose your authenticator.

## Disable 2FA for your instance

Self-hosted users can configure their n8n instance to disable 2FA for all users by setting `N8N_MFA_ENABLED` to false. Note that n8n ignores this if existing users have 2FA enabled. Refer to [Configuration methods](../../hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on configuring your n8n instance with environment variables.

      - TZ=${GENERIC_TIMEZONE}
    volumes:
      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
      - ./local-files:/files

volumes:
  n8n_data:
  traefik_data:

sudo docker compose up -d

sudo docker compose stop
```

You can now reach n8n using the subdomain + domain combination you defined in your `.env` file configuration. The above example would result in `https://n8n.example.com`.

n8n is only accessible using secure HTTPS, not over plain HTTP.

If you have trouble reaching your instance, check your server's firewall settings and your DNS configuration.

- Learn more about [configuring](../../../configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](../../../scaling/overview/) n8n.
- Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](../../../../try-it-out/).

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
## 5. Create local files directory

Inside your project directory, create a directory called `local-files` for sharing files between the n8n instance and the host system (for example, using the [Read/Write Files from Disk node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)):
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
The Docker Compose file below can automatically create this directory, but doing it manually ensures that it's created with the right ownership and permissions.

## 6. Create Docker Compose file

Create a `compose.yaml` file. Paste the following in the file:
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
The Docker Compose file above configures two containers: one for n8n, and one to run [traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik), an application proxy to manage TLS/SSL certificates and handle routing.

It also creates and mounts two [Docker Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) and mounts the `local-files` directory you created earlier:

| Name            | Type                                                        | Container mount   | Description                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `n8n_data`      | [Volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/)   | `/home/node/.n8n` | Where n8n saves its SQLite database file and encryption key.                                                                        |
| `traefik_data`  | [Volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/)   | `/letsencrypt`    | Where traefik saves TLS/SSL certificate data.                                                                                       |
| `./local-files` | [Bind](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/) | `/files`          | A local directory shared between the n8n instance and host. In n8n, use the `/files` path to read from and write to this directory. |

## 7. Start Docker Compose

Start n8n by typing:
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
To stop the containers, type:
```

## Enable Prometheus metrics

**URL:** llms-txt#enable-prometheus-metrics

**Contents:**
- Queue metrics

To collect and expose metrics, n8n uses the [prom-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prom-client) library.

The `/metrics` endpoint is disabled by default, but it's possible to enable it using the `N8N_METRICS` environment variable.

Refer to the respective [Environment Variables](../../environment-variables/endpoints/) (`N8N_METRICS_INCLUDE_*`) for configuring which metrics and labels should get exposed.

Both `main` and `worker` instances are able to expose metrics.

To enable queue metrics, set the `N8N_METRICS_INCLUDE_QUEUE_METRICS` env var to `true`. You can adjust the refresh rate with `N8N_METRICS_QUEUE_METRICS_INTERVAL`.

n8n gathers these metrics from Bull and exposes them on the main instances. On multi-main setups, when aggregating queries, you can identify the leader using the `instance_role_leader` gauge, set to `1` for the leader main and `0` otherwise.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
export N8N_METRICS=true
```

Assistant operations deprecated in OpenAI node V2

n8n version 1.117.0 introduces V2 of the OpenAI node that supports the OpenAI Responses API and removes support for the [to-be-deprecated Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/migration).

## Create an Assistant

Use this operation to create a new assistant.

Enter these parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](../../../credentials/openai/).

- **Resource**: Select **Assistant**.

- **Operation**: Select **Create an Assistant**.

- **Model**: Select the model that the assistant will use. If you’re not sure which model to use, try `gpt-4o` if you need high intelligence or `gpt-4o-mini` if you need the fastest speed and lowest cost. Refer to [Models overview | OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for more information.

- **Name**: Enter the name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters.

- **Description**: Enter the description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters.

- **Instructions**: Enter the system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 32,768 characters. Use this to specify the persona used by the model in its replies.

- **Code Interpreter**: Turn on to enable the code interpreter for the assistant, where it can write and execute code in a sandbox environment. Enable this tool for tasks that require computations, data analysis, or any logic-based processing.

- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Turn on to enable knowledge retrieval for the assistant, allowing it to access external sources or a connected knowledge base. Refer to [File Search | OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search) for more information.

- **Files**: Select a file to upload for your external knowledge source. Use **Upload a File** operation to add more files.

- **Output Randomness (Temperature)**: Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between `0.0` (deterministic) and `1.0` (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Top P)** but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around 0.7) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. Defaults to `1.0`.
- **Output Randomness (Top P)**: Adjust the Top P setting to control the diversity of the assistant's responses. For example, `0.5` means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered. We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Temperature)** but not both. Defaults to `1.0`.
- **Fail if Assistant Already Exists**: If enabled, the operation will fail if an assistant with the same name already exists.

Refer to [Create assistant | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants/createAssistant) documentation for more information.

## Delete an Assistant

Use this operation to delete an existing assistant from your account.

Enter these parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](../../../credentials/openai/).
- **Resource**: Select **Assistant**.
- **Operation**: Select **Message an Assistant**.
- **Assistant**: Select the assistant you want to message.
- **Prompt**: Enter the text prompt or message that you want to send to the assistant.
  - **Connected Chat Trigger Node**: Automatically use the input from a previous node's `chatInput` field.
  - **Define Below**: Manually define the prompt by entering static text or using an expression to reference data from previous nodes.

- **Base URL**: Enter the base URL that the assistant should use for making API requests. This option is useful for directing the assistant to use endpoints provided by other LLM providers that offer an OpenAI-compatible API.
- **Max Retries**: Specify the number of times the assistant should retry an operation in case of failure.
- **Timeout**: Set the maximum amount of time in milliseconds, that the assistant should wait for a response before timing out. Use this option to prevent long waits during operations.
- **Preserve Original Tools**: Turn off to remove the original tools associated with the assistant. Use this if you want to temporarily remove tools for this specific operation.

## Role-based access control (RBAC)

**URL:** llms-txt#role-based-access-control-(rbac)

**Contents:**
- Create a project
- Add and remove users in a project
- Delete a project
- Move workflows and credentials between projects or users
- Using external secrets in projects

RBAC is available on all plans except the Community edition. Different plans have different numbers of projects and roles. Refer to n8n's [pricing page](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for plan details.

Role types and account types

Role types and [account types](../account-types/) are different things. Every account has one type. The account can have different role types for different [projects](projects/).

RBAC is a way of managing access to workflows and [credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n) based on user roles and projects. You group workflows into projects, and user access depends on the user's project role. This section provides guidance on using RBAC in n8n.

- [Role types](/user-management/rbac/role-types/)
- [Projects](/user-management/rbac/projects/)

RBAC is available on all plans except the Community edition. Different plans have different numbers of projects and roles. Refer to n8n's [pricing page](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for plan details.

n8n uses projects to group workflows and [credentials](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n), and assigns [roles](../role-types/) to users in each project. This means that a single user can have different roles in different projects, giving them different levels of access.

Instance owners and instance admins can create projects.

1. Select **Add project**.
1. Fill out the project settings.
1. Select **Save**.

## Add and remove users in a project

Project admins can add and remove users.

To add a user to a project:

1. Select the project.
1. Select **Project settings**.
1. Under **Project members**, browse for users or search by username or email address.
1. Select the user you want to add.
1. Check the [role type](../role-types/) and change it if needed.
1. Select **Save**.

To remove a user from a project:

1. Select the project.
1. Select **Project settings**.
1. In the **three-dot menu** for the user you want to remove, select **Remove user**.
1. Select **Save**.

1. Select the project.
1. Select **Project settings**.
1. Select **Delete project**.
1. Choose what to do with the workflows and credentials. You can select:
   - **Transfer its workflows and credentials to another project**: n8n prompts you to choose a project to move the data to.
   - **Delete its workflows and credentials**: n8n prompts you to confirm that you want to delete all the data in the project.

## Move workflows and credentials between projects or users

Workflow and credential owners can move workflows or credentials (changing ownership) to other users or projects they have access to.

Moving revokes sharing

Moving workflows or credentials removes all existing sharing. Be aware that this could impact other workflows currently sharing these resources.

1. Select **Workflow menu** or **Credential menu** > **Move**.

Moving workflows with credentials

When moving a workflow with credentials you have permission to share, you can choose to share the credentials as well. This ensures that the workflow continues to have access to the credentials it needs to execute. n8n will note any credentials that can't be moved (credentials you don't have permission to share).

1. Select the project or user you want to move to.

1. Confirm you understand the impact of the move: workflows may stop working if the credentials they need aren't available in the target project, and n8n removes any current individual sharing.

1. Select **Confirm move to new project**.

## Using external secrets in projects

To use [external secrets](../../../external-secrets/) in a project, you must have an [instance owner or instance admin](../../account-types/) as a member of the project.

## Troubleshooting OIDC SSO

**URL:** llms-txt#troubleshooting-oidc-sso

**Contents:**
- Known issues
  - State parameter not supported
  - PKCE not supported

### State parameter not supported

When using OIDC providers that enforce the use of the `state` CSRF token parameter, authentication fails with the error:

n8n's current OIDC implementation doesn't handle the `state` parameter that some OIDC providers send as a security measure against CSRF attacks.

For now, the only work around is to configure your OIDC provider to disable the `state` parameter if possible.

n8n is working on adding full support for the OIDC `state` parameter in a future release.

### PKCE not supported

OIDC providers that require PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) may fail authentication or reject n8n's authorization requests. n8n's current OIDC implementation doesn't support PKCE.

The only work around is to configure your OIDC provider to not require PKCE for the n8n client if this option is available in your providers settings.

n8n plans on adding PKCE support in a future release

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
{"code":0,"message":"authorization response from the server is an error"}

## Custom variables

**URL:** llms-txt#custom-variables

**Contents:**
- Create variables
- Edit and delete variables
- Use variables in workflows

- Available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Pro Cloud plans.
- Only instance owners and admins can create variables.

Custom variables are read-only variables that you can use to store and reuse values in n8n workflows.

Variable scope and availability

- **Global variables** are available to everyone on your n8n instance, across all projects.
- **Project-scoped variables** are available only within the specific project they're created in.
- Project-scoped variables are available in 1.118.0 and above. Previous versions only support global variables accessible from the left side menu.

You can access the **Variables** tab from either the overview page or a specific project.

To create a new variable:

1. On the **Variables** tab, select **Add Variable**.
1. Enter a **Key** and **Value**. The maximum key length is 50 characters, and the maximum value length is 1000 characters. n8n limits the characters you can use in the key and value to lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and underscores (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`).
1. Select the **Scope** (only available when creating from the overview page):
   - **Global**: The variable is available across all projects in the n8n instance.
   - **Project**: The variable is available only within a specific project (you can select which project).
   - When creating from a project page, the scope is automatically set to that project.
1. Select **Save**. The variable is now available for use in workflows according to its scope.

## Edit and delete variables

To edit or delete a variable:

1. On the **Variables** tab, hover over the variable you want to change.
1. Select **Edit** or **Delete**.

## Use variables in workflows

You can access variables in the Code node and in [expressions](../../glossary/#expression-n8n):

All variables are strings.

During workflow execution, n8n replaces the variables with the variable value. If the variable has no value, n8n treats its value as `undefined`. Workflows don't automatically fail in this case.

When a project-scoped variable has the same key as a global variable, the project-scoped variable value takes precedence and overrides the global variable value within that project's workflows.

Variables are read-only. You must use the UI to change the values. If you need to set and access custom data within your workflow, use [Workflow static data](../cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data/).

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
// Access a variable
$vars.<variable-name>
```

## Set up SAML

**URL:** llms-txt#set-up-saml

**Contents:**
- Enable SAML
- Generic IdP setup
- Setup resources for common IdPs

- Available on Enterprise plans.
- You need to be an instance owner or admin to enable and configure SAML.

1. In n8n, go to **Settings** > **SSO**.
1. Make a note of the n8n **Redirect URL** and **Entity ID**.
   1. **Optional**: if your IdP allows you to set up SAML from imported metadata, navigate to the **Entity ID** URL and save the XML.
   1. **Optional**: if you are running n8n behind a load balancer make sure you have `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL` configured.
1. Set up SAML with your IdP (identity provider). You need the redirect URL and entity ID. You may also need an email address and name for the IdP user.
1. After completing setup in your IdP, load the metadata XML into n8n. You can use a metadata URL or raw XML:
   1. **Metadata URL**: Copy the metadata URL from your IdP into the **Identity Provider Settings** field in n8n.
   1. **Raw XML**: Download the metadata XML from your IdP, toggle **Identiy Provider Settings** to **XML**, then copy the raw XML into **Identity Provider Settings**.
1. Select **Save settings**.
1. Select **Test settings** to check your SAML setup is working.
1. Set SAML 2.0 to **Activated**.

Please note, n8n currently doesn't support `POST` binding. Please configure your IdP to use `HTTP` request binding instead.

The steps to configure the IdP vary depending on your chosen IdP. These are some common setup tasks:

- Create an app for n8n in your IdP.

- Map n8n attributes to IdP attributes:

| Name                                                                 | Name format   | Value (IdP side) |
  | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
  | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress` | URI Reference | User email       |
  | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/firstname`    | URI Reference | User First Name  |
  | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/lastname`     | URI Reference | User Last Name   |
  | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn`          | URI Reference | User Email       |

## Setup resources for common IdPs

Documentation links for common IdPs.

## Declarative-style parameters

**URL:** llms-txt#declarative-style-parameters

**Contents:**
- `methods` and `loadOptions`
- `routing`
- `version`

These are the parameters available for [node base file](../) of declarative-style nodes.

This document gives short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For a full walk-through of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a declarative-style node](../../../declarative-style-node/).

Refer to [Standard parameters](../standard-parameters/) for parameters available to all nodes.

## `methods` and `loadOptions`

*Object* | *Optional*

`methods` contains the `loadOptions` object. You can use `loadOptions` to query the service to get user-specific settings, then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries. The object must include routing information for how to query the service, and output settings that define how to handle the returned options. For example:

*Object* | *Required*

`routing` is an object used within an `options` array in operations and input field objects. It contains the details of an API call.

The code example below comes from the [Declarative-style tutorial](../../../declarative-style-node/). It sets up an integration with a NASA API. It shows how to use `requestDefaults` to set up the basic API call details, and `routing` to add information for each operation.

*Number* or *Array* | *Optional*

If you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support more than one version, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.

n8n supports two methods of node versioning, but declarative-style nodes must use the light versioning approach. Refer to [Node versioning](../../node-versioning/) for more information.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
methods : {
	loadOptions: {
		routing: {
			request: {
				url: '/webhook/example-option-parameters',
				method: 'GET',
			},
			output: {
				postReceive: [
					{
						// When the returned data is nested under another property
						// Specify that property key
						type: 'rootProperty',
						properties: {
							property: 'responseData',
						},
					},
					{
						type: 'setKeyValue',
						properties: {
							name: '={{$responseItem.key}} ({{$responseItem.value}})',
							value: '={{$responseItem.value}}',
						},
					},
					{
						// If incoming data is an array of objects, sort alphabetically by key
						type: 'sort',
						properties: {
							key: 'name',
						},
					},
				],
			},
		},
	}
},
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
description: INodeTypeDescription = {
  // Other node info here
  requestDefaults: {
			baseURL: 'https://api.nasa.gov',
			url: '',
			headers: {
				Accept: 'application/json',
				'Content-Type': 'application/json',
			},
		},
    properties: [
      // Resources here
      {
        displayName: 'Operation'
        // Other operation details
        options: [
          {
            name: 'Get'
            value: 'get',
            description: '',
            routing: {
              request: {
                method: 'GET',
                url: '/planetary/apod'
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }

## Copy work between environments

**URL:** llms-txt#copy-work-between-environments

**Contents:**
- Single branch
- Multiple branches
- Automatically send changes to n8n

The steps to send work from one n8n instance to another are different depending on whether you use a single Git branch or multiple branches.

If you have a single Git branch the steps to copy work are:

1. Push work from one instance to the Git branch.
1. Log in to the other instance to pull the work from Git. You can [automate pulls](#automatically-send-changes-to-n8n).

If you have more than one Git branch, you need to merge the branches in your Git provider to copy work between environments. You can't copy work directly between environments in n8n.

1. Do work in your developments instance.
1. Push the work to the development branch in Git.
1. Merge your development branch into your production branch. Refer to the documentation for your Git provider for guidance on doing this:
   - [GitHub: Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
   - [GitLab: Creating merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html)
   - [Git: Basic branching and merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)
1. In your production n8n instance, pull the changes. You can [automate pulls](#automatically-send-changes-to-n8n).

## Automatically send changes to n8n

You can automate parts of the process of copying work, using the `/source-control/pull` API endpoint. Call the API after merging the changes:

This means you can use a GitHub Action or GitLab CI/CD to automatically pull changes to the production instance on merge.

A GitHub Action example:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
curl --request POST \
	--location '<YOUR-INSTANCE-URL>/api/v1/source-control/pull' \
	--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	--header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <YOUR-API-KEY>' \
	--data '{"force": true}'
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
name: CI
on:
  # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request events for the "production" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "production" ]
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  run-pull:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: PULL
				# Use GitHub secrets to protect sensitive information
        run: >
          curl --location '${{ secrets.INSTANCE_URL }}/version-control/pull' --header
          'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: ${{ secrets.INSTANCE_API_KEY }}'
```

  - Create your Google OAuth client credentials
  - Finish your n8n credential
- Video
- Scopes
- Troubleshooting

This document contains instructions for creating a generic OAuth2 Google credential for use with [custom operations](../../../../custom-operations/).

Note for n8n Cloud users

For the following nodes, you can authenticate by selecting **Sign in with Google** in the OAuth section:

- [Google Calendar](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlecalendar/)
- [Google Contacts](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlecontacts/)

- [Google Sheets Trigger](../../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheetstrigger/)
- [Google Tasks](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googletasks/)

- Create a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) account.

There are five steps to connecting your n8n credential to Google services:

1. [Create a Google Cloud Console project](#create-a-google-cloud-console-project).
1. [Enable APIs](#enable-apis).
1. [Configure your OAuth consent screen](#configure-your-oauth-consent-screen).
1. [Create your Google OAuth client credentials](#create-your-google-oauth-client-credentials).
1. [Finish your n8n credential](#finish-your-n8n-credential).

### Create a Google Cloud Console project

First, create a Google Cloud Console project. If you already have a project, jump to the [next section](#enable-apis):

1. Log in to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) using your Google credentials.

1. In the top menu, select the project dropdown in the top navigation and select **New project** or go directly to the [New Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) page.

1. Enter a **Project name** and select the **Location** for your project.

1. Select **Create**.

1. Check the top navigation and make sure the project dropdown has your project selected. If not, select the project you just created.

Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

With your project created, enable the APIs you'll need access to:

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.

Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

1. Go to **APIs & Services > Library**.

1. Search for and select the API(s) you want to enable. For example, for the Gmail node, search for and enable the Gmail API.

1. Some integrations require other APIs or require you to request access:

- Google Perspective: [Request API Access](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-get-started).
   - Google Ads: Get a [Developer Token](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token).

Google Drive API required

The following integrations require the Google Drive API, as well as their own API:

- Google Docs
   - Google Sheets
   - Google Slides

In addition to the Vertex AI API you will also need to enable the [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/).

1. Select **ENABLE**.

### Configure your OAuth consent screen

If you haven't used OAuth in your Google Cloud project before, you'll need to [configure the OAuth consent screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent):

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.

Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

1. Open the left navigation menu and go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**. Google will redirect you to the Google Auth Platform overview page.

1. Select **Get started** on the **Overview** tab to begin configuring OAuth consent.

1. Enter an **App name** and **User support email** to include on the Oauth screen. Select **Next** to continue.

1. For the **Audience**, select **Internal** for user access within your organization's Google workspace or **External** for any user with a Google account. Refer to Google's [User type documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549945?sjid=17061891731152303663-EU#user-type) for more information on user types. Select **Next** to continue.

1. Select the **Email addresses** Google should use to contact you about changes to your project. Select **Next** to continue.

1. Read and accept the Google's User Data Policy. Select **Continue** and then select **Create**.

1. In the left-hand menu, select **Branding**.

1. In the **Authorized domains** section, select **Add domain**:

- If you're using n8n's Cloud service, add `n8n.cloud`
   - If you're [self-hosting](../../../../../hosting/), add the domain of your n8n instance.

1. Select **Save** at the bottom of the page.

### Create your Google OAuth client credentials

Next, create the OAuth client credentials in Google:

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Make sure you're in the correct project.
1. In the **APIs & Services** section, select [**Credentials**](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
1. Select **+ Create credentials** > **OAuth client ID**.
1. In the **Application type** dropdown, select **Web application**.
1. Google automatically generates a **Name**. Update the **Name** to something you'll recognize in your console.
1. From your n8n credential, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**. Paste it into the **Authorized redirect URIs** in Google Console.
1. Select **Create**.

### Finish your n8n credential

With the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential:

1. From Google's **OAuth client created** modal, copy the **Client ID**. Enter this in your n8n credential.

1. From the same Google modal, copy the **Client Secret**. Enter this in your n8n credential.

1. You must provide the scopes for this credential. Refer to [Scopes](#scopes) for more information. Enter multiple scopes in a space-separated list, for example:

1. In n8n, select **Sign in with Google** to complete your Google authentication.

1. **Save** your new credentials.

The following video demonstrates the steps described above:

Google services have one or more possible access scopes. A scope limits what a user can do. Refer to [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) for a list of scopes for all services.

n8n doesn't support all scopes. When creating a generic Google OAuth2 API credential, you can enter scopes from the **Supported scopes** list below. If you enter a scope that n8n doesn't already support, it won't work.

### Google hasn't verified this app

If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning **Google hasn't verified this app**. To avoid this:

- If your app **User Type** is **Internal**, create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate.
- If your app **User Type** is **External**, you can add your email to the list of testers for the app: go to the [**Audience**](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience) page and add the email you're signing in with to the list of **Test users**.

If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in [Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/reference/errors/authorization#google_hasnt_verified_this_app).

### Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized

For Google Cloud apps with **Publishing status** set to **Testing** and **User type** set to **External**, consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to [Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615?hl=en#zippy=%2Ctesting) for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.action.compose
```

- Append or Update Row
  - Options
- Append Row
  - Options
- Clear a sheet
- Create a new sheet
  - Options
- Delete a sheet
- Delete Rows or Columns
- Get Row(s)

Use this operation to create, update, clear or delete a sheet in a Google spreadsheet from Google Sheets. Refer to [Google Sheets](../) for more information on the Google Sheets node itself.

This node can be used as an AI tool

This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](../../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).

## Append or Update Row

Use this operation to update an existing row or add a new row at the end of the data if a matching entry isn't found in a sheet.

Enter these parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [Google Sheets credentials](../../../credentials/google/).
- **Resource**: Select **Sheet Within Document**.
- **Operation**: Select **Append or Update Row**.
- **Document**: Choose a spreadsheet that contains the sheet you want to append or update row(s) to.
  - Select **From list** to choose the spreadsheet title from the dropdown list, **By URL** to enter the url of the spreadsheet, or **By ID** to enter the `spreadsheetId`.
  - You can find the `spreadsheetId` in a Google Sheets URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/spreadsheetId/edit#gid=0`.
- **Sheet**: Choose a sheet you want to append or update row(s) to.
  - Select **From list** to choose the sheet title from the dropdown list, **By URL** to enter the url of the sheet, **By ID** to enter the `sheetId`, or **By Name** to enter the sheet title.
  - You can find the `sheetId` in a Google Sheets URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/aBC-123_xYz/edit#gid=sheetId`.
- **Mapping Column Mode**:
  - **Map Each Column Manually**: Enter **Values to Send** for each column.
  - **Map Automatically**: n8n looks for incoming data that matches the columns in Google Sheets automatically. In this mode, make sure the incoming data fields are the same as the columns in Google Sheets. (Use an [Edit Fields](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node before this node to change them if required.)
  - **Nothing**: Don't map any data.

- **Cell Format**: Use this option to choose how to format the data in cells. Refer to [Google Sheets API | CellFormat](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/cells#CellFormat) for more information.
  - **Let Google Sheets format** (default): n8n formats text and numbers in the cells according to Google Sheets' default settings.
  - **Let n8n format**: New cells in your sheet will have the same data types as the input data provided by n8n.
- **Data Location on Sheet**: Use this option when you need to specify the data range on your sheet.
  - **Header Row**: Specify the row index that contains the column headers.
  - **First Data Row**: Specify the row index where the actual data starts.
- **Handling extra fields in input**: When using **Mapping Column Mode > Map Automatically**, use this option to decide how to handle fields in the input data that don't match any existing columns in the sheet.
  - **Insert in New Column(s)** (default): Adds new columns for any extra data.
  - **Ignore Them**: Ignores extra data that don't match the existing columns.
  - **Error**: Throws an error and stops execution.
- **Use Append**: Turn on this option to use the [Google API append endpoint](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/values#append_values) for adding new data rows.
  - By default, n8n appends empty rows or columns and then adds the new data. This approach can ensure data alignment but may be less efficient. Using the append endpoint can lead to better performance by minimizing the number of API calls and simplifying the process. But if the existing sheet data has inconsistencies such as gaps or breaks between rows and columns, n8n may add the new data in the wrong place, leading to misalignment issues.
  - Use this option when performance is a priority and the data structure in the sheet is consistent without gaps.

Refer to the [Method: spreadsheets.values.update | Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets.values/update) API documentation for more information.

- **Resource**: Select **Sheet Within Document**.
- **Operation**: Select **Get Row(s)**.
- **Document**: Choose a spreadsheet that contains the sheet you want to get rows from.
  - Select **From list** to choose the spreadsheet title from the dropdown list, **By URL** to enter the url of the spreadsheet, or **By ID** to enter the `spreadsheetId`.
  - You can find the `spreadsheetId` in a Google Sheets URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/spreadsheetId/edit#gid=0`.
- **Sheet**: Choose a sheet you want to read rows from.
  - Select **From list** to choose the sheet title from the dropdown list, **By URL** to enter the url of the sheet, **By ID** to enter the `sheetId`, or **By Name** to enter the name of the sheet.
  - You can find the `sheetId` in a Google Sheets URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/aBC-123_xYz/edit#gid=sheetId`.
- **Filters**: By default, the node returns all rows in the sheet. Set filters to return a limited set of results:
  - **Column**: Select the column in your sheet to search against.
  - **Value**: Enter a cell value to search for. You can drag input data parameters here. If your filter matches multiple rows, n8n returns the first result. If you want all matching rows:
    1. Under **Options**, select **Add Option** > **When Filter Has Multiple Matches**.
    1. Change **When Filter Has Multiple Matches** to **Return All Matches**.

- **Data Location on Sheet**: Use this option to specify a data range. By default, n8n will detect the range automatically until the last row in the sheet.
- **Output Formatting**: Use this option to choose how n8n formats the data returned by Google Sheets.
- **General Formatting**:
  - **Values (unformatted)** (default): n8n removes currency signs and other special formatting. Data type remains as number.
  - **Values (formatted)**: n8n displays the values as they appear in Google Sheets (for example, retaining commas or currency signs) by converting the data type from number to string.
  - **Formulas**: n8n returns the formula. It doesn't calculate the formula output. For example, if a cell B2 has the formula `=A2`, n8n returns B2's value as `=A2` (in text). Refer to [About date & time values | Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/formats#about_date_time_values) for more information.
- **Date Formatting**: Refer to [DateTimeRenderOption | Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/DateTimeRenderOption) for more information.
  - **Formatted Text** (default): As displayed in Google Sheets, which depends on the spreadsheet locale. For example `01/01/2024`.
  - **Serial Number**: Number of days since December 30th 1899.
- **When Filter Has Multiple Matches**: Set to **Return All Matches** to get multiple matches. By default only the first result gets returned.

n8n treats the first row in a Google Sheet as a heading row, and doesn't return it when reading all rows. If you want to read the first row, use the **Options** to set **Data Location on Sheet**.

Refer to the [Method: spreadsheets.batchUpdate | Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/batchUpdate) API documentation for more information.

- **Mapping Column Mode**:
  - **Map Each Column Manually**: Enter **Values to Send** for each column.
  - **Map Automatically**: n8n looks for incoming data that matches the columns in Google Sheets automatically. In this mode, make sure the incoming data fields are the same as the columns in Google Sheets. (Use an [Edit Fields](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node before this node to change them if required.)
  - **Nothing**: Don't map any data.

- **Cell Format**: Use this option to choose how to format the data in cells. Refer to [Google Sheets API | CellFormat](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/cells#CellFormat) for more information.
  - **Let Google Sheets format** (default): n8n formats text and numbers in the cells according to Google Sheets' default settings.
  - **Let n8n format**: New cells in your sheet will have the same data types as the input data provided by n8n.
- **Data Location on Sheet**: Use this option when you need to specify where the data range on your sheet.
  - **Header Row**: Specify the row index that contains the column headers.

### Using DigitalOcean Spaces

To configure the credential for use with DigitalOcean spaces:

1. In DigitalOceans, go to the control panel and open **Settings**. Your endpoint should be listed there. Prepend `https://` to that endpoint and enter it as the **S3 Endpoint** in n8n.
   - Your DigitalOceans endpoint depends on the data center region your bucket's in.
1. For the **Region**, enter the region your bucket's located in, for example, `nyc3`.
   - If you plan to use this credential to create new Spaces, enter `us-east-1` instead.
1. From your DigitalOceans control panel, go to [**API**](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/spaces).
1. Open the **Spaces Keys** tab.
1. Select **Generate New Key**.
1. Enter a **Name** for your key, like `n8n integration` and select the checkmark.
1. Copy the **Key** displayed next to the name and enter this as the **Access Key ID** in n8n.
1. Copy the **Secret** value and enter this as the **Secret Access Key** in n8n.
   - Refer to [Sharing Access to Buckets with Access Keys](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/how-to/manage-access/#access-keys) for more information on generating the key and secret.
1. Keep the **Force Path Style** toggle turned off unless you want to use subdomain/virtual calling format.
1. Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:
   - To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of **Ignore SSL Issues** turned off.
   - To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.

Refer to DigitalOcean's [Spaces API Reference Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/) for more information.

To configure the credential for use with Wasabi:

1. For the **S3 Endpoint**, enter the service URL for your bucket's region. Start it with `https://`.
   - Refer to [Service URLs for Wasabi's Storage Regions](https://docs.wasabi.com/v1/docs/service-urls-for-wasabis-storage-regions) to identify the correct URL.
1. For the **Region**, enter the region slug portion of the service URL. For example, if you entered `https://s3.us-east-2.wasabisys.com` as the **S3 Endpoint**, `us-east-2` is the region.
1. Log into you Wasabi Console as the root user.
1. Open the **Menu** and select **Access Keys**.
1. Select **CREATE NEW ACCESS KEY**.
1. Select whether the key is for the **Root User** or a **Sub-User** and select **CREATE**.
1. Copy the **Access Key** and enter it in n8n as the **Access Key ID**.

If you've found your way here, it means you're serious about your interest in automation. Maybe you're tired of manually entering data into the same spreadsheet every day, of clicking through a series of tabs and buttons for that one piece of information you need, of managing tens of different tools and systems.

Whatever the reason, one thing is clear: you shouldn't spend precious time doing things that don't spark joy or contribute to your personal and professional growth.

These tasks can and should be automated! And you don't need advanced technical knowledge or excellent coding skills to do this–with no-code tools like n8n, automation is for everyone.

## What's a chain in AI?

**URL:** llms-txt#what's-a-chain-in-ai?

**Contents:**
- Chains in n8n

[Chains](../../../glossary/#ai-chain) bring together different components of AI to create a cohesive system. They set up a sequence of calls between the components. These components can include models and [memory](../../../glossary/#ai-memory) (though note that in n8n chains can't use memory).

n8n provides three chain nodes:

- [Basic LLM Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/): use to interact with an LLM, without any additional components.
- [Question and Answer Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/): can connect to a [vector store](../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store) using a retriever, or to an n8n workflow using the Workflow Retriever node. Use this if you want to create a workflow that supports asking questions about specific documents.
- [Summarization Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainsummarization/): takes an input and returns a summary.

There's an important difference between chains in n8n and in other tools such as LangChain: none of the chain nodes support memory. This means they can't remember previous user queries. If you use LangChain to code an AI application, you can give your application memory. In n8n, if you need your workflow to support memory, use an agent. This is essential if you want users to be able to have a natural ongoing conversation with your app.

## Push and pull

**Contents:**
- Fetch other people's work
  - Workflow and credential owner may change on pull
  - Pulling may cause brief service interruption
- Send your work to Git
- What gets committed
- Merge behaviors and conflicts
  - Workflows
  - Credentials, variables and workflow tags

If your n8n instance connects to a Git repository, you need to keep your work in sync with Git.

This document assumes some familiarity with Git concepts and terminology. Refer to [Git and n8n](../../understand/git/) for an introduction to how n8n works with Git.

Recommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance

You can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both.

## Fetch other people's work

n8n roles control which users can pull (fetch) changes

You must be an instance owner or instance admin to pull changes from git.

To pull work from Git, select **Pull** in the main menu.

Pull and push buttons when menu is closed

Pull and push buttons when menu is open

n8n may display a warning about overriding local changes. Select **Pull and override** to override your local work with the content in Git.

When the changes include new variable or credential stubs, n8n notifies you that you need to populate the values for the items before using them.

How deleted resources are handled

When workflows, credentials, variables, and tags are deleted from the repository, your local versions of these resources aren't deleted automatically. Instead, when you pull repository changes, n8n notifies you about any outdated resources and asks if you'd like to delete them.

### Workflow and credential owner may change on pull

When you pull from Git to an n8n instance, n8n tries to assign workflows and credentials to a matching user or project.

If the original owner is a user:

If the same owner is available on both instances (matching email), the owner remains the same. If the original owner isn't on the new instance, n8n sets the user performing the pull as the workflow owner.

If the original owner is a [project](../../../user-management/rbac/):

n8n tries to match the original project name to a project name on the new instance. If no matching project exists, n8n creates a new project with the name, assigns the current user as project owner, and imports the workflows and credentials to the project.

### Pulling may cause brief service interruption

If you pull changes to an active workflow, n8n sets the workflow to inactive while pulling, then reactivates it. This may result in a few seconds of downtime for the workflow.

## Send your work to Git

n8n roles control which users can push changes

You must be an instance owner, instance admin, or project admin to push changes to git.

1. Select **Push** in the main menu.

Pull and push buttons when menu is closed

Pull and push buttons when menu is open

1. In the **Commit and push changes** modal, select which workflows you want to push. You can filter by status (new, modified, deleted) and search for workflows. n8n automatically pushes tags, and variable and credential stubs.

1. Enter a commit message. This should be a one sentence description of the changes you're making.

1. Select **Commit and Push**. n8n sends the work to Git, and displays a success message on completion.

## What gets committed

n8n commits the following to Git:

- Workflows, including their tags and the email address of the workflow owner. You can choose which workflows to push.
- Credential stubs (ID, name, type)
- Variable stubs (ID and name)
- Projects
- Folders

## Merge behaviors and conflicts

n8n's implementation of source control is opinionated. It resolves merge conflicts for credentials and variables automatically. n8n can't detect conflicts on workflows.

You have to explicitly tell n8n what to do about workflows when pushing or pulling. The Git repository acts as the source of truth.

When pulling, you might get warned that your local copy of a workflow differs from Git, and if you accept, your local copy would be overridden. Be careful not to lose relevant changes when pulling.

When you push, your local workflow will override what's in Git, so make sure that you have the most up to date version or you risk overriding recent changes.

To prevent the issue described above, you should immediately push your changes to a workflow once you finish working on it. Then it's safe to pull.

To avoid losing data:

- Design your source control setup so that workflows flow in one direction. For example, make edits on a development instance, push to Git, then pull to production. Don't make edits on the production instance and push them.
- Don't push all workflows. Select the ones you need.
- Be cautious about manually editing files in the Git repository.

### Credentials, variables and workflow tags

Credentials and variables can't have merge issues, as n8n chooses the version to keep.

- If the tag, variable or credential doesn't exist, n8n creates it.
- If the tag, variable or credential already exists, n8n doesn't update it, unless:
  - You set the value of a variable using the API or externally. The new value overwrites any existing value.
  - The credential name has changed. n8n uses the version in Git.
  - The name of a tag has changed. n8n updates the tag name. Be careful when renaming tags as tag names are unique and this could cause database issues when it comes to uniqueness during the pull process.

- n8n overwrites the entire variables and tags files.
- If a credential already exists, n8n overwrites it with the changes, but doesn't apply these changes to existing credentials on pull.

Manage credentials with an external secrets vault

If you need different credentials on different n8n environments, use [external secrets](../../../external-secrets/).

- Your **WebDAV URL**
- Your **User** name
- Your **Password** or an app password

1. To create your **WebDAV URL**: If Nextcloud is in the root of your domain: Enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add `/remote.php/webdav/`. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, your WebDAV URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/remote.php/webdav`.
   - If you have Nextcloud installed in a subdirectory, enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add `/<subdirectory>/remote.php/webdav/`. Replace `<subdirectory>` with the subdirectory Nextcloud's installed in.
   - Refer to Nextcloud's [Third-party WebDAV clients](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/user_manual/en/files/access_webdav.html#third-party-webdav-clients) documentation for more information on constructing your WebDAV URL.
1. Enter your **User** name.
1. For the **Password**, Nextcloud recommends using an app password rather than your user password. To create an app password:
   1. In the Nextcloud Web interface, select your avatar in the top right and select **Personal settings**.
   1. In the left menu, choose **Security**.
   1. Scroll to the bottom to the **App Password** section and create a new app password.
   1. Copy that app password and enter it in n8n as your **Password**.

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) account and:

- An **Authorization URL** and **Access Token URL**: These depend on the URL you use to access Nextcloud.
- A **Client ID**: Generated once you add an OAuth2 client application in **Administrator Security Settings**.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated once you add an OAuth2 client application in **Administrator Security Settings**.
- A **WebDAV URL**: This depends on the URL you use to access Nextcloud.

1. In Nextcloud, open your **Administrator Security Settings**.

1. Find the **Add client** section under **OAuth 2.0 clients**.

1. Enter a **Name** for your client, like `n8n integration`.

1. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and enter it as the **Redirection URI**.

1. Then select **Add** in Nextcloud.

1. In n8n, update the **Authorization URL** to replace `https://nextcloud.example.com` with the URL you use to access Nextcloud. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, the Authorization URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/apps/oauth2/authorize`.

1. In n8n, update the **Access Token URL** to replace `https://nextcloud.example.com` with the URL you use to access Nextcloud. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, the Access Token URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/apps/oauth2/api/v1/token`.

Pretty URL configuration

The **Authorization URL** and **Access Token URL** assume that you've configured Nextcloud to use [Pretty URLs](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#pretty-urls). If you haven't, you must add `/index.php/` between your Nextcloud URL and the `/apps/oauth2` portion, for example: `https://cloud.n8n.com/index.php/apps/oauth2/api/v1/token`.

1. Copy the Nextcloud **Client Identifier** for your OAuth2 client and enter it as the **Client ID** in n8n.

1. Copy the Nextcloud **Secret** and enter it as the **Client Secret** in n8n.

1. In n8n, to create your **WebDAV URL**: If Nextcloud is in the root of your domain, enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add `/remote.php/webdav/`. For example, if you access Nextcloud at `https://cloud.n8n.com`, your WebDAV URL is `https://cloud.n8n.com/remote.php/webdav`.

- If you have Nextcloud installed in a subdirectory, enter the URL you use to access Nextcloud and add `/<subdirectory>/remote.php/webdav/`. Replace `<subdirectory>` with the subdirectory Nextcloud's installed in.
   - Refer to Nextcloud's [Third-party WebDAV clients](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/user_manual/en/files/access_webdav.html#third-party-webdav-clients) documentation for more information on constructing your WebDAV URL.

## Configure n8n to use your own certificate authority or self-signed certificate

**URL:** llms-txt#configure-n8n-to-use-your-own-certificate-authority-or-self-signed-certificate

**Contents:**
- Docker
  - Docker CLI
  - Docker Compose
- Certificate requirements for Custom Trust Store

You can add your own certificate authority (CA) or self-signed certificate to n8n. This means you are able to trust a certain SSL certificate instead of trusting all invalid certificates, which is a potential security risk.

Added in version 1.42.0

This feature is available in version 1.42.0 and above.

To use this feature you need to place your certificates in a folder and mount the folder to `/opt/custom-certificates` in the container. The external path that you map to `/opt/custom-certificates` must be writable by the container.

The examples below assume you have a folder called `pki` that contains your certificates in either the directory you run the command from or next to your docker compose file.

When using the CLI you can use the `-v` flag from the command line:

You should also give the right permissions to the imported certs. You can do this once the container is running (assuming n8n as the container name):

## Certificate requirements for Custom Trust Store

Supported certificate types:

- Root CA Certificates: these are certificates from Certificate Authorities that sign other certificates. Trust these to accept all certificates signed by that CA.
- Self-Signed Certificates: certificates that servers create and sign themselves. Trust these to accept connections to that specific server only.

You must use PEM format:

- Text-based format with BEGIN/END markers
- Supported file extensions: `.pem`, `.crt`, `.cer`
- Contains the public certificate (no private key needed)

The system doesn't accept:

- DER/binary format files
- PKCS#7 (.p7b) files
- PKCS#12 (.pfx, .p12) files
- Private key files
- Convert these formats to PEM before use.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
docker run -it --rm \
 --name n8n \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -v ./pki:/opt/custom-certificates \
 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
name: n8n
services:
    n8n:
        volumes:
            - ./pki:/opt/custom-certificates
        container_name: n8n
        ports:
            - 5678:5678
        image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
docker exec --user 0 n8n chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/custom-certificates
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDXTCCAkWgAwIBAgIJAKoK/heBjcOuMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBBQUAMEUxCzAJBgNV
[base64 encoded data]
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

n8n creates the webhook URL by combining `N8N_PROTOCOL`, `N8N_HOST` and `N8N_PORT`. If n8n runs behind a reverse proxy, that won't work. That's because n8n runs internally on port 5678 but the reverse proxy exposes it to the web on port 443.

When running n8n behind a reverse proxy, it's important to do the following:

- set the webhook URL manually with the `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable so that n8n can display it in the editor UI and register the correct webhook URLs with external services.
- Set the `N8N_PROXY_HOPS` environment variable to `1`.
- On the last proxy on the request path, set the following headers to pass on information about the initial request:
  - [`X-Forwarded-For`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-Forwarded-For)
  - [`X-Forwarded-Host`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-Forwarded-Host)
  - [`X-Forwarded-Proto`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-Forwarded-Proto)

Refer to [Environment variables reference](../../environment-variables/endpoints/) for more information on this variable.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
export WEBHOOK_URL=https://n8n.example.com/
export N8N_PROXY_HOPS=1
```

- Customising input
- Observing the conversation
- Adding persistence

## AI concepts in n8n

If you're already familiar with AI, feel free to skip this section. This is a basic introduction to AI concepts and how they can be used in n8n workflows.

An [AI agent](../../glossary/#ai-agent) builds on [Large Language Models (LLMs)](../../glossary/#large-language-model-llm), which generate text based on input by predicting the next word. While LLMs only process input to produce output, AI agents add goal-oriented functionality. They can use [tools](../../glossary/#ai-tool), process their outputs, and make decisions to complete tasks and solve problems.

In n8n, the AI agent is represented as a node with some extra connections.

| Feature             | LLM                        | AI Agent                           |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Core Capability     | Text generation            | Goal-oriented task completion      |
| Decision-Making     | None                       | Yes                                |
| Uses Tools/APIs     | No                         | Yes                                |
| Workflow Complexity | Single-step                | Multi-step                         |
| Scope               | Generates language         | Performs complex, real-world tasks |
| Example             | LLM generating a paragraph | An agent scheduling an appointment |

By incorporating the AI agent as a node, n8n can combine AI-driven steps with traditional programming for efficient, real-world workflows. For instance, simpler tasks, like validating an email address, do not require AI, whereas a complex tasks, like processing the *content* of an email or dealing with multimodal inputs (e.g., images, audio), are excellent uses of an AI agent.

## 1. Create a new workflow

When you open n8n, you'll see either:

- An empty workflow: if you have no workflows and you're logging in for the first time. Use this workflow.
- The **Workflows** list on the **Overview** page. Select the **button** to create a new workflow.

## 2. Add a trigger node

Every workflow needs somewhere to start. In n8n these are called ['trigger nodes'](../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n). For this workflow, we want to start with a chat node.

1. Select **Add first step** or press `Tab` to open the node menu.
1. Search for **Chat Trigger**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
1. Select **Chat Trigger** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
1. Close the node details view (Select **Back to canvas**) to return to the canvas.

More about the Chat Trigger node...

The trigger node generates output when there is an event causing it to trigger. In this case we want to be able to type in text to cause the workflow to run. In production, this trigger can be hooked up to a public chat interface as provided by n8n or embedded into another website. To start this simple workflow we will just use the built-in local chat interface to communicate, so no further setup is required.

[View workflow file](/_workflows//advanced-ai/tutorials/chat_01.json)

## 3. Add an AI Agent Node

The AI Agent node is the core of adding AI to your workflows.

1. Select the **Add node** connector on the trigger node to bring up the node search.
1. Start typing "AI" and choose the **AI agent** node to add it.
1. The editing view of the **AI agent** will now be displayed.
1. There are some fields which can be changed. As we're using the **Chat Trigger** node, the default setting for the source and specification of the prompt don't need to be changed.

[View workflow file](/_workflows//advanced-ai/tutorials/chat_02.json)

## 4. Configure the node

AI agents require a chat model to be attached to process the incoming prompts.

1. Add a chat model by clicking the plus button underneath the **Chat Model** connection on the **AI Agent** node (it's the first connection along the bottom of the node).
1. The search dialog will appear, filtered on 'Language Models'. These are the models with built-in support in n8n. For this tutorial we will use **OpenAI Chat Model**.
1. Selecting the **OpenAI Chat model** from the list will attach it to the **AI Agent** node and open the node editor. One of the parameters which can be changed is the 'Model'. Note that for the basic OpenAI accounts, only the 'gpt-4o-mini' model is allowed.

As mentioned earlier, the LLM is the component which generates the text according to a prompt it is given. LLMs have to be created and trained, usually an intensive process. Different LLMS may have different capabilities or specialties, depending on the data they were trained with.

## 5. Add credentials (if needed)

In order for n8n to communicate with the chat model, it will need some [credentials](../../credentials/) (login data giving it access to an account on a different online service). If you already have credentials set up for OpenAI, these should appear by default in the credentials selector. Otherwise you can use the Credentials selector to help you add a new credential.

1. To add a new credential, click on the text which says 'Select credential'. An option to add a new credential will appear
1. This credential just needs an API key. When adding credentials of any type, check the text to the right-hand side. In this case it has a handy link to take you straight to your OpenAI account to retrieve the API key.
1. The API key is just one long string. That's all you need for this particular credential. Copy it from the OpenAI website and paste it into the **API key** section.

Keeping your credentials safe

Credentials are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node. The type of information required varies depending on the app/service concerned. You should be careful about sharing or revealing the credentials outside of n8n.

Now that the node is connected to the **Chat Trigger** and a chat model, we can test this part of the workflow.

1. Click on the 'Chat' button near the bottom of the canvas. This opens up a local chat window on the left and the AI agent logs on the right.
1. Type in a message and press `Enter`. You will now see the response from the chat model appear below your message.
1. The log window displays the inputs to and outputs from the AI Agent.

Accessing the logs...

You can access the logs for the AI node even when you aren't using the chat interface. Open up the **AI Agent** node and click on the **Logs** tab in the right hand panel.

## 7. Changing the prompt

The logs in the previous step reveal some extra data - the system prompt. This is the default message that the **AI Agent** primes the chat model with. From the log you can see this is set to "You are a helpful assistant". We can however change this prompt to alter the behavior of the chat model.

1. Open the **AI Agent** node. In the bottom of the panel is a section labeled 'Options' and a selector labeled 'Add Option'. Use this to select 'System message'
1. The system message is now displayed. This is the same priming prompt we noticed before in the logs. Change the prompt to something else to prime the chat model in a different way. You could try something like "You are a brilliant poet who always replies in rhyming couplets" for example.
1. Close the node and return to the chat window. Repeat your message and notice how the output has changed.

## 8. Adding persistence

The chat model is now giving us useful output, but there is something wrong with it which will become apparent when you try to have a conversation.

1. Use the chat and tell the chat model your name, for example "Hi there, my name is Nick".
1. Wait for the response, then type the message "What's my name?". The AI will not be able to tell you, however apologetic it may seem. The reason for this is we are not saving the context. The AI Agent has no [memory](../../glossary/#ai-memory).
1. In order to remember what has happened in the conversation, the AI Agent needs to preserve context. We can do this by adding memory to the **AI Agent** node. On the canvas click on the on the bottom of the **AI Agent** node labeled "Memory".
1. From the panel which appears, select "Simple Memory". This will use the memory from the instance running n8n, and is usually sufficient for simple usage. The default value of 5 interactions should be sufficient here, but remember where this option is if you may want to change it later.
1. Repeat the exercise of having a conversation above, and see that the AI Agent now remembers your name.

## 9. Saving the workflow

Before we leave the workflow editor, remember to save the workflow or all your changes will be lost.

1. Click on the "Save" button in the top right of the editor window. Your workflow will now be saved and you can return to it later to chat again or add new features.

You have taken your first steps in building useful and effective workflows with AI. In this tutorial we have investigated the basic building blocks of an AI workflow, added an **AI Agent** and a chat model, and adjusted the prompt to get the kind of output we wanted. We also added memory so the chat could retain context between messages.

## Environments in n8n

**URL:** llms-txt#environments-in-n8n

**Contents:**
- Environments: What and why
- Environments in n8n

n8n has built its environments feature on top of Git, a version control software. This document helps you understand:

- The purpose of environments.
- How environments work in n8n.

## Environments: What and why

In software development, the environment is all the infrastructure and tooling around the code, including the tools that run the software, and the specific configuration of those tools. For a more detailed introduction to environments in software development, refer to [Codecademy | Environments](https://www.codecademy.com/article/environments).

Low-code development in n8n is similar. n8n is where you build and run your workflows. Your instance may have particular configurations: on Cloud, n8n determines the configuration. On self-hosted instances, there are extensive [configuration options](../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/). You may also have made changes to the settings of your instance. This combination of n8n and your instance's specific configuration and settings is the environment your workflows run in.

There are advantages to having more than one environment. A common pattern is to have different environments for development and production:

- Development: do work and make changes.
- Production: the live environment.

A setup like this helps you make changes to workflows without breaking workflows that are in use.

## Environments in n8n

In n8n, an environment comprises two parts, an n8n instance and a Git branch:

- The n8n instance is where you build and run workflows.
- The Git branch stores copies of the workflows, as well as tags, and variable and credential stubs.

n8n doesn't sync credentials and variable values with Git. You must set up the credentials and variable values manually when setting up a new instance. For more information, refer to [Push and pull | What gets committed](../../using/push-pull/#what-gets-committed).

How you copy work between environments depends on your branch and n8n instance configuration:

- Multiple instances, one branch: you can push from one instance to the Git branch, then pull the work to another instance.
- Multiple instances, multiple branches: you need to create a pull request and merge in your Git provider. For example, if you have development, test, and production branches, each linked to their own instance, you need to merge the development branch into test to make the work from the development instance available on the test instance. Refer to [Copy work between environments](../../using/copy-work/) for more information, including steps to partially automate the process.

For detailed guidance on pushing and pulling work, refer to [Push and pull](../../using/push-pull/).

Refer to [Set up source control](../../setup/) to learn more about linking your n8n instance to Git, or follow the [Tutorial: Create environments with source control](../../create-environments/) to set up your environments using one of n8n's recommended configurations.

## Send Email credentials

**URL:** llms-txt#send-email-credentials

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Supported authentication methods
- Related resources
- Using SMTP account
  - Provider instructions
  - My provider isn't listed

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Send Email](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendemail/)

- Create an email account on a service that supports SMTP.
- Some email providers require that you enable or set up outgoing SMTP or generate an app password. Refer to your provider's documentation to see if there are other required steps.

## Supported authentication methods

Simple Message Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a standard protocol for sending and receiving email. Most email providers offer instructions on setting up their service with SMTP. Refer to your provider's SMTP instructions.

## Using SMTP account

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **User** email address
- A **Password**: This may be the user's password or an app password. Refer to the documentation for your email provider.
- The **Host**: The SMTP host address for your email provider, often formatted as `smtp.<provider>.com`. Check with your provider.
- A **Port** number: The port depends on the encryption method:
- Port `465` for SSL/TLS (implicit encryption)
- Port `587` for STARTTLS (explicit encryption)
- Port `25` for no encryption (not recommended) Check with your email provider for their specific requirements.
- **SSL/TLS**: This toggle controls the encryption method:
- Turn **ON** for port `465` (uses implicit SSL/TLS encryption)
- Turn **OFF** for port `587` (uses STARTTLS explicit encryption)
- Turn **OFF** for port `25` (no encryption)
- **Disable STARTTLS**: When SSL/TLS is disabled, the SMTP server can still try to [upgrade the TCP connection using STARTTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS). Turning this on prevents that behaviour.
- **Client Host Name**: If needed by your provider, add a client host name. This name identifies the client to the server.

### Provider instructions

Refer to the quickstart guides for these common email providers.

Refer to [Gmail](gmail/).

Refer to [Outlook.com](outlook/).

Refer to [Yahoo](yahoo/).

### My provider isn't listed

If your email provider isn't listed here, search for `SMTP settings` to find their instructions. (These instructions may also be included with `IMAP settings` or `POP settings`.)

## Merging and splitting data

**URL:** llms-txt#merging-and-splitting-data

**Contents:**
- Merging data
  - Merge Exercise
- Looping
- Splitting data in batches
  - Loop/Batch Exercise

In this chapter, you will learn how to merge and split data, and in what cases it might be useful to perform these operations.

In some cases, you might need to merge (combine) and process data from different sources.

Merging data can involve:

- Creating one data set from multiple sources.
- Synchronizing data between multiple systems. This could include removing duplicate data or updating data in one system when it changes in another.

One-way vs. two-way sync

In a one-way sync, data is synchronized in one direction. One system serves as the single source of truth. When information changes in that main system, it automatically changes in the secondary system; but if information changes in the secondary system, the changes aren't reflected in the main system.

In a two-way sync, data is synchronized in both directions (between both systems). When information changes in either of the two systems, it automatically changes in the other one as well.

[This blog tutorial](https://blog.n8n.io/how-to-sync-data-between-two-systems/) explains how to sync data one-way and two-way between two CRMs.

In n8n, you can merge data from two different nodes using the [Merge node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/), which provides several merging options:

- [Append](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#append)
- [Combine](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#combine)
  - [Merge by Fields](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#combine-by-matching-fields): requires input fields to match on
  - [Merge by Position](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#combine-by-position)
  - [Combine all possible combinations](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#combine-by-all-possible-combinations)
- [Choose Branch](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#choose-branch)

Notice that Combine > Merge by Fields requires you enter input fields to match on. These fields should contain identical values between the data sources so n8n can properly match data together. In the **Merge node**, they're called `Input 1 Field` and `Input 2 Field`.

*Property Input fields in the Merge node*

Property Input in dot notation

If you want to reference nested values in the **Merge node** parameters `Input 1 Field` and `Input 2 Field`, you need to enter the property key in dot-notation format (as text, not as an expression).

You can also find the **Merge node** under the alias Join. This might be more intuitive if you're familiar with SQL joins.

Build a workflow that merges data from the Customer Datastore node and Code node.

1. Add a **Merge node** that takes `Input 1` from a **Customer Datastore node** and `Input 2` from a **Code node**.
1. In the **Customer Datastore node**, run the operation **Get All People**.
1. In the **Code node**, create an array of two objects with three properties: `name`, `language`, and `country`, where the property `country` has two sub-properties `code` and `name`.
   - Fill out the values of these properties with the information of two characters from the Customer Database.
   - For example, Jay Gatsby's language is English and country name is United States.
1. In the **Merge node**, try out different merge options.

The workflow for this exercise looks like this:

*Workflow exercise for merging data*

If you merge data with the option **Keep Matches** using the name as the input fields to match, the result should look like this (note this example only contains Jay Gatsby; yours might look different depending on which characters you selected):

*Output of Merge node with option to keep matches*

To check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:

In some cases, you might need to perform the same operation on each element of an array or each data item (for example sending a message to every contact in your address book). In technical terms, you need to iterate through the data (with loops).

n8n generally handles this repetitive processing automatically, as the nodes run once for each item, so you don't need to build loops into your workflows.

However, there are some [exceptions of nodes and operations](../../../flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions) that will require you to build a loop into your workflow.

To [create a loop in an n8n workflow](../../../flow-logic/looping/#using-loops-in-n8n), you need to connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node, and add an **If node** to check when to stop the loop.

## Splitting data in batches

If you need to process large volumes of incoming data, execute the **Code node** multiple times, or avoid API rate limits, it's best to split the data into batches (groups) and process these batches.

For these processes, use the [**Loop Over Items node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/). This node splits input data into a specified batch size and, with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data.

Execution of Loop Over Items node

The **Loop Over Items node** stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow, so it's not necessary to add an **If node** to stop the loop.

### Loop/Batch Exercise

Build a workflow that reads the RSS feed from Medium and dev.to. The workflow should consist of three nodes:

1. A **Code node** that returns the URLs of the RSS feeds of Medium (`https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io`) and dev.to (`https://dev.to/feed/n8n`).
1. A **Loop Over Items node** with `Batch Size: 1`, that takes in the inputs from the **Code node** and **RSS Read node** and iterates over the items.
1. An **RSS Read node** that gets the URL of the Medium RSS feed, passed as an expression: `{{ $json.url }}`.
   - The **RSS Read node** is one of the [exception nodes](../../../flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions) which processes only the first item it receives, so the **Loop Over Items node** is necessary for iterating over multiple items.

1. Add a **Code Node**. You can format the code in several ways, one way is:
   - Set **Mode** to `Run Once for All Items`.

- Set **Language** to `JavaScript`.

- Copy the code below and paste it into the JavaScript Code editor:

1. Add a **Loop Over Items node** connected to the **Code node**.
   - Set **Batch Size** to `1`.
1. The **Loop Over Items node** automatically adds a node called "Replace Me". Replace that node with an **RSS Read node**.
   - Set the **URL** to use the url from the Code Node: `{{ $json.url }}`.

The workflow for this exercise looks like this:

*Workflow for getting RSS feeds from two blogs*

To check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:

## Get the binary data buffer

**URL:** llms-txt#get-the-binary-data-buffer

The binary data buffer contains all the binary file data processed by a workflow. You need to access it if you want to perform operations on the binary data, such as:

- Manipulating the data: for example, adding column headers to a CSV file.
- Using the data in calculations: for example, calculating a hash value based on it.
- Complex HTTP requests: for example, combining file upload with sending other data formats.

Not available in Python

`getBinaryDataBuffer()` isn't supported when using Python.

You can access the buffer using n8n's `getBinaryDataBuffer()` function:

You should always use the `getBinaryDataBuffer()` function, and avoid using older methods of directly accessing the buffer, such as targeting it with expressions like `items[0].binary.data.data`.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
/* 
* itemIndex: number. The index of the item in the input data.
* binaryPropertyName: string. The name of the binary property. 
* The default in the Read/Write File From Disk node is 'data'. 
*/
let binaryDataBufferItem = await this.helpers.getBinaryDataBuffer(itemIndex, binaryPropertyName);
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
let binaryDataBufferItem = await this.helpers.getBinaryDataBuffer(0, 'data');
// Returns the data in the binary buffer for the first input item
```

## SSH credentials

**URL:** llms-txt#ssh-credentials

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Supported authentication methods
- Related resources
- Using password
- Using private key

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [SSH](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.ssh/)

- Create a remote server with SSH enabled.
- Create a user account that can `ssh` into the server using one of the following:
  - Their own [password](#using-password)
  - An SSH [private key](#using-private-key)

## Supported authentication methods

- [Password](#using-password): Use this method if you have a user account that can `ssh` into the server using their own password.
- [Private key](#using-private-key): Use this method if you have a user account that uses an SSH key for the server or service.

Secure Shell (SSH) protocol is a method for securely sending commands over a network. Refer to [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) for an example of SSH setup.

Use this method if you have a user account that can `ssh` into the server using their own password.

To configure this credential, you'll need to:

1. Enter the IP address of the server you're connecting to as the **Host**.
1. Enter the **Port** to use for the connection. SSH uses port `22` by default.
1. Enter the **Username** for a user account with `ssh` access on the server.
1. Enter the **Password** for that user account.

Use this method if you have a user account that uses an SSH key for the server or service.

To configure this credential, you'll need to:

1. Enter the IP address of the server you're connecting to as the **Host**.
1. Enter the **Port** to use for the connection. SSH uses port `22` by default.
1. Enter the **Username** of the account that generated the private key.
1. Enter the entire contents of your SSH **Private Key**.
1. If you created a **Passphrase** for the **Private Key**, enter the passphrase.
   - If you didn't create a passphrase for the key, leave blank.

## Account types

**URL:** llms-txt#account-types

There are three account types: owner, admin, and member. The account type affects the user permissions and access.

To use admin accounts, you need a pro or enterprise plan.

Account types and role types

Account types and role types are different things. Role types are part of [RBAC](../rbac/).

Every account has one type. The account can have different [role types](../rbac/role-types/) for different [projects](../rbac/projects/).

Create a member-level account for the owner

n8n recommends that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see and edit all workflows, credentials, and projects. However, there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.

| Permission                                                          | Owner | Admin | Member |

## What you can do

**URL:** llms-txt#what-you-can-do

**Contents:**
- All users
- Self-hosted users
  - GDPR for self-hosted users

It's also your responsibility as a customer to ensure you are securing your code and data. This document lists some steps you can take.

- Report security issues and [terms of service](https://n8n.io/legal/#terms) violations to security@n8n.io.
- If more than one person uses your n8n instance, set up [User management](../../user-management/) and follow the [Best practices](../../user-management/best-practices/).
- Use OAuth to connect integrations whenever possible.

If you self-host n8n, there are additional steps you can take:

- Set up a reverse proxy to handle TLS, ensuring data is encrypted in transit.
- Ensure data is encrypted at rest by using encrypted partitions, or encryption at the hardware level, and ensuring n8n and its database is written to that location.
- Run a [Security audit](../../hosting/securing/security-audit/).
- Be aware of the [Risks](../../integrations/community-nodes/risks/) when installing community nodes, or choose to disable them.
- Make sure users can't import external modules in the Code node. Refer to [Environment variables | Nodes](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes/) for more information.
- Choose to exclude certain nodes. For example, you can disable nodes like Execute Command or SSH. Refer to [Environment variables | Nodes](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/nodes/) for more information.
- For maximum privacy, you can [Isolate n8n](../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/isolation/).

### GDPR for self-hosted users

If you self-host n8n, you are responsible for deleting user data. If you need to delete data on behalf of one of your users, you can delete the respective execution. n8n recommends configuring n8n to prune execution data automatically every few days to avoid effortful GDPR request handling as much as possible. Configure this using the `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` environment variable. Refer to [Environment variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for more information.

## Troubleshooting and errors

**URL:** llms-txt#troubleshooting-and-errors

**Contents:**
- Error: Missing packages
- Prevent loading community nodes on n8n cloud

## Error: Missing packages

n8n installs community nodes directly onto the hard disk. The files must be available at startup for n8n to load them. If the packages aren't available at startup, you get an error warning of missing packages.

If running n8n using Docker: depending on your Docker setup, you may lose the packages when you recreate your container or upgrade your n8n version. You must either:

- Persist the contents of the `~/.n8n/nodes` directory. This is the best option. If you follow the [Docker installation](../../../hosting/installation/docker/) guide, the setup steps include persisting this directory.
- Set the `N8N_REINSTALL_MISSING_PACKAGES` environment variable to `true`.

The second option might increase startup time and may cause health checks to fail.

## Prevent loading community nodes on n8n cloud

If your n8n cloud instance crashes and fails to start, you can prevent installed community nodes from loading on instance startup. Visit the [Cloud Admin Panel](../../../manage-cloud/cloud-admin-dashboard/) > **Manage** and toggle **Disable all community nodes** to **`true`**. This toggle is only visible when you allow community node installation.

---

## Item linking

**URL:** llms-txt#item-linking

Programmatic-style nodes only

This guidance applies to programmatic-style nodes. If you're using declarative style, n8n handles paired items for you automatically.

Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. n8n needs to know which input item a given output item comes from. If this information is missing, expressions in other nodes may break. As a node developer, you must ensure any items returned by your node support this.

This applies to programmatic nodes (including trigger nodes). You don't need to consider item linking when building a declarative-style node. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](../../../plan/choose-node-method/) for more information on node styles.

Start by reading [Item linking concepts](../../../../../data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/), which provides a conceptual overview of item linking, and details of the scenarios where n8n can handle the linking automatically.

If you need to handle item linking manually, do this by setting `pairedItem` on each item your node returns:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
// Use the pairedItem information of the incoming item
newItem = {
	"json": { . . . },
	"pairedItem": {
		"item": item.pairedItem,
		// Optional: choose the input to use
		// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
		"input": 0
};

// Or set the index manually
newItem = {
		"json": { . . . }
		"pairedItem": {
			"item": i,
			// Optional: choose the input to use
			// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
			"input": 0
		},
};
```

## Light evaluations

**URL:** llms-txt#light-evaluations

**Contents:**
- What are light evaluations?
- How it works
  - 1. Create a dataset
  - 2. Wire the dataset up to your workflow
  - 3. Write workflow outputs back to dataset
  - 4. Run evaluation

Available on registered community and paid plans

Light evaluations are available to registered community users and on all paid plans.

## What are light evaluations?

When building your workflow, you often want to test it with a handful of examples to get a sense of how it performs and make improvements. At this stage of workflow development, looking over workflow outputs for each example is often enough. The benefits of setting up more [formal scoring or metrics](../metric-based-evaluations/) don't yet justify the effort.

Light evaluation allows you to run the examples in a test dataset through your workflow one-by-one, writing the outputs back to your dataset. You can then examine those outputs next to each other, and visually compare them to the expected outputs (if you have them).

Credentials for Google Sheets

Evaluations use data tables or Google Sheets to store the test dataset. To use Google Sheets as a dataset source, configure a [Google Sheets credential](../../../integrations/builtin/credentials/google/).

Light evaluations take place in the 'Editor' tab of your workflow, although you’ll find instructions on how to set it up in the 'Evaluations' tab.

1. Create a dataset
1. Wire the dataset up to the workflow
1. Write workflow outputs back to dataset
1. Run evaluation

The following explanation will use a sample workflow that assigns a category and priority to incoming support tickets.

### 1. Create a dataset

Create a data table or Google Sheet with a handful of examples for your workflow. Your dataset should contain columns for:

- The workflow input
- (Optional) The expected or correct workflow output
- The actual output

Leave the actual output column or columns blank, since you'll be filling them during the evaluation.

A [sample dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uuPS5cHtSNZ6HNLOi75A2m8nVWZrdBZ_Ivf58osDAS8/edit?gid=294497137#gid=294497137) for the support ticket classification workflow.

### 2. Wire the dataset up to your workflow

#### Insert an evaluation trigger to pull in your dataset

Each time the [evaluation trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.evaluationtrigger/) runs, it will output a single item representing one row of your dataset.

Clicking the 'Evaluate all' button to the left of the evaluation trigger will run your workflow multiple times in sequence, once for each row in your dataset. This is a special behavior of the evaluation trigger.

While wiring the trigger up, you often only want to run it once. You can do this by either:

- Setting the trigger's 'Max rows to process' to 1
- Clicking on the 'Execute node' button on the trigger (rather than the 'Evaluate all' button)

#### Wire the trigger up to your workflow

You can now connect the evaluation trigger to the rest of your workflow and reference the data that it outputs. At a minimum, you need to use the dataset’s input column(s) later in the workflow.

If you have multiple triggers in your workflow you will need to [merge their branches together](../tips-and-common-issues/#combining-multiple-triggers).

The support ticket classification workflow with the evaluation trigger added in and wired up.

### 3. Write workflow outputs back to dataset

To populate the output column(s) of your dataset when the evaluation runs:

- Insert the 'Set outputs' action of the [evaluation node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.evaluation/)
- Wire it up to your workflow at a point after it has produced the outputs you're evaluating
- In the node's parameters, map the workflow outputs into the correct dataset column

The support ticket classification workflow with the 'set outputs' node added in and wired up.

### 4. Run evaluation

Click on the **Execute workflow** button to the left of the evaluation trigger. The workflow will execute multiple times, once for each row of the dataset:

Review the outputs of each execution in the data table or Google Sheet, and examine the execution details using the workflow's 'executions' tab if you need to.

Once your dataset grows past a handful of examples, consider [metric-based evaluation](../metric-based-evaluations/) to get a numerical view of performance. See also [tips and common issues](../tips-and-common-issues/).

## Programmatic-style parameters

**URL:** llms-txt#programmatic-style-parameters

**Contents:**
- `defaultVersion`
- `methods` and `loadOptions`
- `version`

These are the parameters available for [node base file](../) of programmatic-style nodes.

This document gives short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For a full walk-through of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a programmatic-style node](../../../programmatic-style-node/).

Programmatic-style nodes also use the `execute()` method. Refer to [Programmatic-style execute method](../programmatic-style-execute-method/) for more information.

Refer to [Standard parameters](../standard-parameters/) for parameters available to all nodes.

*Number* | *Optional*

Use `defaultVersion` when using the full versioning approach.

n8n support two methods of node versioning. Refer to [Node versioning](../../node-versioning/) for more information.

## `methods` and `loadOptions`

*Object* | *Optional*

Contains the `loadOptions` method for programmatic-style nodes. You can use this method to query the service to get user-specific settings (such as getting a user's email labels from Gmail), then return them and render them in the GUI so the user can include them in subsequent queries.

For example, n8n's [Gmail node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Gmail/Gmail.node.ts) uses `loadOptions` to get all email labels:

*Number* or *Array* | *Optional*

Use `version` when using the light versioning approach.

If you have one version of your node, this can be a number. If you want to support multiple versions, turn this into an array, containing numbers for each node version.

n8n support two methods of node versioning. Programmatic-style nodes can use either. Refer to [Node versioning](../../node-versioning/) for more information.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
methods = {
		loadOptions: {
			// Get all the labels and display them
			async getLabels(
				this: ILoadOptionsFunctions,
			): Promise<INodePropertyOptions[]> {
				const returnData: INodePropertyOptions[] = [];
				const labels = await googleApiRequestAllItems.call(
					this,
					'labels',
					'GET',
					'/gmail/v1/users/me/labels',
				);
				for (const label of labels) {
					const labelName = label.name;
					const labelId = label.id;
					returnData.push({
						name: labelName,
						value: labelId,
					});
				}
				return returnData;
			},
		},
	};
```

## Troubleshooting

**URL:** llms-txt#troubleshooting

**Contents:**
- Credentials
  - Error message: 'Credentials of type "\*" aren't known'
- Editor UI
  - Error message: 'There was a problem loading init data: API-Server can not be reached. It's probably down'
  - Node icon doesn't show up in the Add Node menu and the Editor UI
  - Node icon doesn't fit
  - Node doesn't show up in the Add Node menu
  - Changes to the description properties don't show in the UI on refreshing
  - Linter incorrectly warning about file name case

### Error message: 'Credentials of type "\*" aren't known'

Check that the name in the credentials array matches the name used in the property name of the credentials' class.

### Error message: 'There was a problem loading init data: API-Server can not be reached. It's probably down'

- Check that the names of the node file, node folder, and class match the path added to `packages/nodes-base/package.json`.
- Check that the names used in the `displayOptions` property are names used by UI elements in the node.

### Node icon doesn't show up in the Add Node menu and the Editor UI

- Check that the icon is in the same folder as the node.
- Check that it's either in PNG or SVG format.
- When the `icon` property references the icon file, check that it includes the logo extension (`.png` or `.svg`) and that it prefixes it with `file:`. For example, `file:friendGrid.png` or `file:friendGrid.svg`.

### Node icon doesn't fit

- If you use an SVG file, make sure the canvas size is square. You can find instructions to change the canvas size of an SVG file using GIMP [here](https://docs.gimp.org/2.10/en/gimp-image-resize.html).
- If you use a PNG file, make sure that it's 60x60 pixels.

### Node doesn't show up in the Add Node menu

Check that you registered the node in the `package.json` file in your project.

### Changes to the description properties don't show in the UI on refreshing

Every time you change the description properties, you have to stop the current n8n process (`ctrl` + `c`) and run it again. You may also need to re-run `npm link`.

### Linter incorrectly warning about file name case

The node linter has rules for file names, including what case they should be. Windows users may encounter an issue when renaming files that causes the linter to continue giving warnings, even after you rename the files. This is due to a [known Windows issue](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/file-renaming-when-changing-case-doesnt-work/aa15ff7c-dd2d-4ed3-bcce-799ca90d4e58) with changing case when renaming files.

n8n uses Git to provide source control. To use this feature, it helps to have some knowledge of basic Git concepts. n8n doesn't implement all Git functionality: you shouldn't view n8n's source control as full version control.

New to Git and source control?

If you're new to Git, don't panic. You don't need to learn Git to use n8n. This document explains the concepts you need. You do need some Git knowledge to set up the source control, as this involves work in your Git provider.

Familiar with Git and source control?

If you're familiar with Git, don't rely on behaviors matching exactly. In particular, be aware that source control in n8n doesn't support a pull request-style review and merge process, unless you do this outside n8n in your Git provider.

This page introduces the Git concepts and terminology used in n8n. It doesn't cover everything you need to set up and manage a repository. The person doing the [Setup](../../setup/) should have some familiarity with Git and with their Git hosting provider.

This is a brief introduction

Git is a complex topic. This section provides a brief introduction to the key terms you need when using environments in n8n. If you want to learn about Git in depth, refer to [GitHub | Git and GitHub learning resources](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources).

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a tool for managing, tracking, and collaborating on multiple versions of documents. It's the basis for widely used platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/).

## Branches: Multiple copies of a project

Git uses branches to maintain multiple copies of a document alongside each other. Every branch has its own version. A common pattern is to have a main branch, and then everyone who wants to contribute to the project works on their own branch (copy). When they finish their work, their branch is merged back into the main branch.

## Local and remote: Moving work between your machine and a Git provider

A common pattern when using Git is to install Git on your own computer, and use a Git provider such as GitHub to work with Git in the cloud. In effect, you have a Git repository (project) on GitHub, and work with copies of it on your local machine.

n8n uses this pattern for source control: you'll work with your workflows on your n8n instance, but send them to your Git provider to store them.

## Push, pull, and commit

n8n uses three key Git processes:

- **Push**: send work from your instance to Git. This saves a copy of your workflows and tags, as well as credential and variable stubs, to Git. You can choose which workflows you want to save.

- **Pull**: get the workflows, tags, and variables from Git and load it into n8n. You will need to populate any credentials or variable stubs included in the refreshed items.

Pulling overwrites your work

If you have made changes to a workflow in n8n, you must push the changes to Git before pulling. When you pull, it overwrites any changes you've made if they aren't stored in Git.

- **Commit**: a commit in n8n is a single occurrence of pushing work to Git. In n8n, commit and push happen at the same time.

Refer to [Push and pull](../../using/push-pull/) for detailed information about how n8n interacts with Git.

## Tutorial: Create environments with source control

**URL:** llms-txt#tutorial:-create-environments-with-source-control

**Contents:**
- Choose your source control pattern
  - Multiple instances, multiple branches
  - Multiple instances, one branch
- Set up your repository
- Connect your n8n instances to your repository
  - Configure Git in n8n
  - Set up a deploy key
  - Connect n8n and configure your instance
- Push work from development
- Pull work to production

- Available on Enterprise.
- You must be an n8n instance owner or instance admin to enable and configure source control.
- Instance owners and instance admins can push changes to and pull changes from the connected repository.
- Project admins can push changes to the connected repository. They can't pull changes from the repository.

This tutorial walks through the process of setting up environments end-to-end. You'll create two environments: development and production. It uses GitHub as the Git provider. The process is similar for other providers.

n8n has built its environments feature on top of Git, a version control software. You link an n8n instance to a Git branch, and use a push-pull pattern to move work between environments. You should have some understanding of environments and Git. If you need more information on these topics, refer to:

- [Environments in n8n](../understand/environments/): the purpose of environments, and how they work in n8n.
- [Git and n8n](../understand/git/): Git concepts and source control in n8n.

## Choose your source control pattern

Before setting up source control and environments, you need to plan your environments, and how they relate to Git branches. n8n supports different [Branch patterns](../understand/patterns/). For environments, you need to choose between two patterns: multi-instance, multi-branch, or multi-instance, single-branch. This tutorial covers both patterns.

Recommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance

You can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both.

### Multiple instances, multiple branches

The advantages of this pattern are:

- An added safety layer to prevent changes getting into your production environment by mistake. You have to do a pull request in GitHub to copy work between environments.
- It supports more than two instances.

The disadvantage is more manual steps to copy work between environments.

### Multiple instances, one branch

The advantage of this pattern is that work is instantly available to other environments when you push from one instance.

The disadvantages are:

- If you push by mistake, there is a risk the work will make it into your production instance. If you [use a GitHub Action to automate pulls](./#optional-use-a-github-action-to-automate-pulls) to production, you must either use the multi-instance, multi-branch pattern, or be careful to never push work that you don't want in production.
- Pushing and pulling to the same instance can cause data loss as changes are overridden when performing these actions. You should set up processes to ensure content flows in one direction.

## Set up your repository

Once you've chosen your pattern, you need to set up your GitHub repository.

1. [Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).
   - Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.
   - Create the new repository with a README so you can immediately create branches.
1. Create one branch named `production` and another named `development`. Refer to [Creating and deleting branches within your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) for guidance.

[Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).

- Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.
- Create the new repository with a README. This creates the `main` branch, which you'll connect to.

## Connect your n8n instances to your repository

Create two n8n instances, one for development, one for production.

### Configure Git in n8n

1. Go to **Settings** > **Environments**.
1. Choose your connection method:
   - **SSH**: In **Git repository URL**, enter the SSH URL for your repository (for example, `git@github.com:username/repo.git`).
   - **HTTPS**: In **Git repository URL** enter the HTTPS URL for your repository (for example, `https://github.com/username/repo.git`).
1. Configure authentication based on your connection method:
   - **For SSH**: n8n supports ED25519 and RSA public key algorithms. ED25519 is the default. Select **RSA** under **SSH Key** if your git host requires RSA. Copy the SSH key.
   - **For HTTPS**: Enter your credentials:
     - **Username**: Your Git provider username.
     - **Token**: Your Personal Access Token (PAT) from your Git provider.

### Set up a deploy key

Set up SSH access by creating a deploy key for the repository using the SSH key from n8n. The key must have write access. Refer to [GitHub | Managing deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys) for guidance.

### Connect n8n and configure your instance

1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**. n8n connects to your Git repository.

1. Under **Instance settings**, choose which branch you want to use for the current n8n instance. Connect the production branch to the production instance, and the development branch to the development instance.

1. Production instance only: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance.

1. Select **Save settings**.

1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**.

1. Under **Instance settings**, select the main branch.

1. Production instance only: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance.

1. Select **Save settings**.

## Push work from development

In your development instance, create a few workflows, tags, variables, and credentials.

1. Select **Push** in the main menu.

Pull and push buttons when menu is closed

Pull and push buttons when menu is open

1. In the **Commit and push changes** modal, select which workflows you want to push. You can filter by status (new, modified, deleted) and search for workflows. n8n automatically pushes tags, and variable and credential stubs.

1. Enter a commit message. This should be a one sentence description of the changes you're making.

1. Select **Commit and Push**. n8n sends the work to Git, and displays a success message on completion.

## Pull work to production

Your work is now in GitHub. If you're using a multi-branch setup, it's on the development branch. If you chose the single-branch setup, it's on main.

1. In GitHub, create a pull request to merge development into production.
1. Merge the pull request.
1. In your production instance, select **Pull** in the main menu.

In your production instance, select **Pull** in the main menu.

Pull and push buttons when menu is closed

### Optional: Use a GitHub Action to automate pulls

If you want to avoid logging in to your production instance to pull, you can use a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions) and the [n8n API](../../api/) to automatically pull every time you push new work to your production or main branch.

A GitHub Action example:

- [Environments in n8n](../understand/environments/) and [Git and n8n](../understand/git/)
- [Source control patterns](../understand/patterns/)

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
name: CI
on:
  # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request events for the "production" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "production" ]
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  run-pull:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: PULL
				# Use GitHub secrets to protect sensitive information
        run: >
          curl --location '${{ secrets.INSTANCE_URL }}/version-control/pull' --header
          'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: ${{ secrets.INSTANCE_API_KEY }}'
```

## Mattermost credentials

**URL:** llms-txt#mattermost-credentials

**Contents:**
- Supported authentication methods
- Related resources
- Using API access token
- Enable personal access tokens

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Mattermost](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mattermost/)

## Supported authentication methods

Refer to [Mattermost's API documentation](https://api.mattermost.com/) for more information about the service.

## Using API access token

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Mattermost](https://www.mattermost.com/) account and:

- A personal **Access Token**
- Your Mattermost **Base URL**.

1. In Mattermost, go to **Profile > Security > Personal Access Tokens**.

No Personal Access Tokens option

If you don't see the Personal Access Tokens option, refer to the troubleshooting steps in [Enable personal access tokens](#enable-personal-access-tokens) below.

1. Select **Create Token**.

1. Enter a **Token description**, like `n8n integration`.

1. Copy the **Token ID** and enter it as the **Access Token** in your n8n credential.

1. Enter your Mattermost URL as the **Base URL**.

1. By default, n8n connects only if SSL certificate validation succeeds. To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.

Refer to the Mattermost [Personal access tokens documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/reference/personal-access-token/) for more information.

## Enable personal access tokens

Not seeing the **Personal Access Tokens** option has two possible causes:

- Mattermost doesn't have the personal access tokens integration enabled.
- You're trying to generate a personal access token as a non-admin user who doesn't have permission to generate personal access tokens.

To identify the root cause and resolve it:

1. Log in to Mattermost as an admin.
1. Go to **System Console > Integrations > Integration Management**.
1. Confirm that **Enable personal access tokens** is set to **true**. If it's not, change.
1. Go to **System Console > User Management > Users**.
1. Search for the user account you want to allow to generate personal access tokens.
1. Select the **Actions** dropdown for the user and select **Manage roles**.
1. Check the box for **Allow this account to generate personal access tokens** and **Save**.

Refer to the Mattermost [Personal access tokens documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/reference/personal-access-token/) for more information.

## Branch patterns

**URL:** llms-txt#branch-patterns

**Contents:**
- Multiple instances, multiple branches
- Multiple instances, one branch
- One instance, multiple branches
- One instance, one branch

The relationship between n8n instances and Git branches is flexible. You can create different setups depending on your needs.

Recommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance

You can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both.

## Multiple instances, multiple branches

This pattern involves having multiple n8n instances, each one linked to its own branch.

You can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them to their own branches. Push work from your development instance to its branch, do a pull request to move work to the production branch, then pull to the production instance.

The advantages of this pattern are:

- An added safety layer to prevent changes getting into your production environment by mistake. You have to do a pull request in GitHub to copy work between environments.
- It supports more than two instances.

The disadvantage is more manual steps to copy work between environments.

## Multiple instances, one branch

Use this pattern if you want the same workflows, tags, and variables everywhere, but want to use them in different n8n instances.

You can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them both to the same branch. Push work from development, and pull it into production.

This pattern is also useful when testing a new version of n8n: you can create a new n8n instance with the new version, connect it to the Git branch and test it, while your production instance remains on the older version until you're confident it's safe to upgrade.

The advantage of this pattern is that work is instantly available to other environments when you push from one instance.

The disadvantages are:

- If you push by mistake, there is a risk the work will make it into your production instance. If you [use a GitHub Action to automate pulls](../../create-environments/#optional-use-a-github-action-to-automate-pulls) to production, you must either use the multi-instance, multi-branch pattern, or be careful to never push work that you don't want in production.
- Pushing and pulling to the same instance can cause data loss as changes are overridden when performing these actions. You should set up processes to ensure content flows in one direction.

## One instance, multiple branches

The instance owner can change which Git branch connects to the instance. The full setup in this case is likely to be a [Multiple instances, multiple branches](#multiple-instances-multiple-branches) pattern, but with one instance switching between branches.

This is useful to review work. For example, different users could work on their own instance and push to their own branch. The reviewer could work in a review instance, and switch between branches to load work from different users.

n8n doesn't clean up the existing contents of an instance when changing branches. Switching branches in this pattern results in all the workflows from each branch being in your instance.

## One instance, one branch

This is the simplest pattern.

- Set your store to **Allow OAuth Access Tokens to be used as standalone Bearer tokens**.
  - Go to **Admin > Stores > Configuration > Services > OAuth > Consumer Settings**.

- Set the **Allow OAuth Access Tokens to be used as standalone Bearer tokens** option to **Yes**.

- You can also enable this setting from the CLI by running the following command:

This step is necessary until n8n updates the Magento 2 credentials to use OAuth. Refer to [Integration Tokens](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/get-started/authentication/gs-authentication-token/#integration-tokens) for more information.

## Supported authentication methods

Refer to [Magento's API documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/docs/) for more information about the service.

## Using API access token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Host**: Enter the address of your Magento store.
- An **Access Token**: Get an access token from the [**Admin Panel**](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/stores/admin.html):
  1. Go to **System > Extensions > Integrations**.
  1. Add a new Integration.
  1. Go to the **API** tab and select the Magento resources you'd like the n8n integration to access.
  1. From the **Integrations** page, **Activate** the new integration.
  1. Select **Allow** to display your access token so you can copy it and enter it in n8n.

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Simple
  - Random
  - Code
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

Use the Sort node to organize lists of items in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.

The Sort operation uses the default JavaScript operation where the elements to be sorted are converted into strings and their values compared. Refer to [Mozilla's guide to Array sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) to learn more.

Configure this node using the **Type** parameter.

Use the dropdown to select how you want to input the sorting from these options.

Performs an ascending or descending sort using the selected fields.

When you select this **Type**:

- Use the **Add Field To Sort By** button to input the **Field Name**.
- Select whether to use **Ascending** or **Descending** order.

When you select **Simple** as the **Type**, you have the option to **Disable Dot Notation**. By default, n8n enables dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child`. Use this option to disable dot notation (turned on) or to continue using dot (turned off).

Creates a random order in the list.

Input custom JavaScript code to perform the sort operation. This is a good option if a simple sort won't meet your needs.

Enter your custom JavaScript code in the **Code** input field.

## Standard parameters

**URL:** llms-txt#standard-parameters

**Contents:**
- `displayName`
- `name`
- `icon`
- `group`
- `description`
- `defaults`
- `forceInputNodeExecution`
- `inputs`
- `outputs`
- `requiredInputs`

These are the standard parameters for the [node base file](../). They're the same for all node types.

*String* | *Required*

This is the name users see in the n8n GUI.

*String* | *Required*

The internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.

*String* or *Object* | *Required*

Specifies an icon for a particular node. n8n recommends uploading your own image file.

You can provide the icon file name as a string, or as an object to handle different icons for light and dark modes. If the icon works in both light and dark modes, use a string that starts with `file:`, indicating the path to the icon file. For example:

To provide different icons for light and dark modes, use an object with `light` and `dark` properties. For example:

n8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio.

Don't reference Font Awesome

If you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image.

*Array of strings* | *Required*

Tells n8n how the node behaves when the workflow runs. Options are:

- `trigger`: node waits for a trigger.
- `schedule`: node waits for a timer to expire.
- `input`, `output`, `transform`: these currently have no effect.
- An empty array, `[]`. Use this as the default option if you don't need `trigger` or `schedule`.

*String* | *Required*

A short description of the node. n8n uses this in the GUI.

*Object* | *Required*

Contains essential brand and name settings.

The object can include:

- `name`: String. Used as the node name on the canvas if the `displayName` is too long.
- `color`: String. Hex color code. Provide the brand color of the integration for use in n8n.

## `forceInputNodeExecution`

*Boolean* | *Optional*

When building a multi-input node, you can choose to force all preceding nodes on all branches to execute before the node runs. The default is `false` (requiring only one input branch to run).

*Array of strings* | *Required*

Names the input connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the input side. If you need only one connector, use `input: ['main']`.

*Array of strings* | *Required*

Names the output connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the output side. If you need only one connector, use `output: ['main']`.

*Integer* or *Array* | *Optional*

Used for multi-input nodes. Specify inputs by number that must have data (their branches must run) before the node can execute.

*Array of objects* | *Required*

This parameter tells n8n the credential options. Each object defines an authentication type.

The object must include:

- `name`: the credential name. Must match the `name` property in the credential file. For example, `name: 'asanaApi'` in [`Asana.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Asana/Asana.node.ts) links to `name = 'asanaApi'` in [`AsanaApi.credential.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/credentials/AsanaApi.credentials.ts).
- `required`: Boolean. Specify whether authentication is required to use this node.

*Object* | *Required*

Set up the basic information for the API calls the node makes.

This object must include:

- `baseURL`: The API base URL.

- `headers`: an object describing the API call headers, such as content type.
- `url`: string. Appended to the `baseURL`. You can usually leave this out. It's more common to provide this in the `operations`.

*Array of objects* | *Required*

This contains the resource and operations objects that define node behaviors, as well as objects to set up mandatory and optional fields that can receive user input.

A resource object includes the following parameters:

- `displayName`: String. This should always be `Resource`.
- `name`: String. This should always be `resource`.
- `type`: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](../../ui-elements/) for more information.
- `noDataExpression`: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be `true` for `resource`.

### Operations objects

The operations object defines the available operations on a resource.

- `displayName`: String. This should always be `Options`.
- `name`: String. This should always be `option`.
- `type`: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, `dateTime` results in n8n adding a date picker. Refer to [Node UI elements](../../ui-elements/) for more information.
- `noDataExpression`: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be `true` for `operation`.
- `options`: Array of objects. Each objects describes an operation's behavior, such as its routing, the REST verb it uses, and so on. An `options` object includes:
  - `name`. String.
  - `value`. String.
  - `action`: String. This parameter combines the resource and operation. You should always include it, as n8n will use it in future versions. For example, given a resource called `"Card"` and an operation `"Get all"`, your action is `"Get all cards"`.
  - `description`: String.
  - `routing`: Object containing request details.

### Additional fields objects

These objects define optional parameters. n8n displays them under **Additional Fields** in the GUI. Users can choose which parameters to set.

The objects must include:

For more information about UI element types, refer to [UI elements](../../ui-elements/).

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
icon: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg'
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
icon: { 
  light: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg', 
  dark: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.dark.svg' 
}
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
displayName: 'Additional Fields',
name: 'additionalFields',
// The UI element type
type: ''
placeholder: 'Add Field',
default: {},
displayOptions: {
  // Set which resources and operations this field is available for
  show: {
    resource: [
      // Resource names
    ],
    operation: [
      // Operation names
    ]
  },
}
```

## Logging in n8n

**URL:** llms-txt#logging-in-n8n

**Contents:**
- Setup

Logging is an important feature for debugging. n8n uses the [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) logging library.

n8n Self-hosted Enterprise tier includes [Log streaming](../../../log-streaming/), in addition to the logging options described in this document.

To set up logging in n8n, you need to set the following environment variables (you can also set the values in the [configuration file](../../configuration/environment-variables/))

| Setting in the configuration file | Using environment variables | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## HTML

**URL:** llms-txt#html

**Contents:**
- Operations
- Generate HTML template
- Extract HTML Content
  - Source Data
  - Extraction Values
  - Extract HTML Content options
- Convert to HTML Table
- Templates and examples

The HTML node provides operations to help you work with HTML in n8n.

The HTML node replaces the HTML Extract node from version 0.213.0 on. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the [HTML Extract node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/86fe33b681621e618e3adcab9a27e8605dbc23ad/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.htmlextract.md).

When using the HTML node to generate an HTML template you can introduce [XSS (cross-site scripting)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/). This is a security risk. Be careful with un-trusted inputs.

- [**Generate HTML template**](#generate-html-template): Use this operation to create an HTML template. This allows you to take data from your workflow and output it as HTML.
- [**Extract HTML content**](#extract-html-content): Extract contents from an HTML-formatted source. The source can be in JSON or a binary file (`.html`).
- [**Convert to HTML Table**](#convert-to-html-table): Convert content to an HTML table.

The node parameters and options depend on the operation you select. Refer to the sections below for more details on configuring each operation.

## Generate HTML template

Create an HTML template. This allows you to take data from your workflow and output it as HTML.

- Standard HTML
- CSS in `<style>` tags.
- JavaScript in `<script>` tags. n8n doesn't execute the JavaScript.
- Expressions, wrapped in `{{}}`.

You can use [Expressions](../../../../code/expressions/) in the template, including n8n's [Built-in methods and variables](../../../../code/builtin/overview/).

## Extract HTML Content

Extract contents from an HTML-formatted source. The source can be in JSON or a binary file (`.html`).

Use these parameters:

Select the source type for your HTML content. Choose between:

- **JSON**: If you select this source data, enter the **JSON Property**: the name of the input containing the HTML you want to extract. The property can contain a string or an array of strings.
- **Binary**: If you select this source data, enter the **Input Binary Field**: the name of the input containing the HTML you want to extract. The property can contain a string or an array of strings.

### Extraction Values

- **Key**: Enter the key to save the extracted value under.
- **CSS Selector**: Enter the CSS selector to search for.
- **Return Value**: Select the type of data to return. Choose from:
  - **Attribute**: Return an attribute value like `class` from an element.
    - If you select this option, enter the name of the **Attribute** to return the value of.
  - **HTML**: Return the HTML that the element contains.
  - **Text**: Return the text content of the element.
    - If you choose this option, you can also enter a comma-separated list of selectors to skip in the **Skip Selectors**.
  - **Value**: Return the value of an input, select, or text area.
- **Return Array**: Choose whether to return multiple extraction values as an array (turned on) or as a single string (turned off).

### Extract HTML Content options

You can also configure this operation with these options:

- **Trim Values**: Controls whether to remove all spaces and newlines from the beginning and end of the values (turned on) or leaves them (turned off).
- **Clean Up Text**: Controls whether to remove leading whitespaces, trailing whitespaces, and line breaks (newlines) and condense multiple consecutive whitespaces into a single space (turned on) or to leave them as-is (turned off).

## Convert to HTML Table

This operation expects data from another node. It has no parameters. It includes these options:

- **Capitalize Headers**: Controls whether to capitalize the table's headers (turned on) or not (turned off).
- **Custom Styling**: Controls whether to use custom styling (turned on) or not (turned off).
- **Caption**: Enter a caption to add to the table.
- **Table Attributes**: Enter any attributes to apply to the `<table>`, such as style attributes.
- **Header Attributes**: Enter any attributes to apply to the table's headers `<th>`.
- **Row Attributes**: Enter any attributes to apply to the table's rows `<tr>`.
- **Cell Attributes**: Enter any attributes to apply to the table's cells `<td>`.

## Navigating the Editor UI

**URL:** llms-txt#navigating-the-editor-ui

**Contents:**
- Getting started
- Editor UI settings
  - Left-side panel
  - Top bar
  - Canvas
- Nodes
  - Finding nodes
  - Adding nodes
  - Node buttons
- Summary

In this lesson you will learn how to navigate the [Editor UI](../../../glossary/#editor-n8n). We will walk through the [canvas](../../../glossary/#canvas-n8n) and show you what each icon means and where to find things you will need while building workflows in n8n.

This course is based on n8n version 1.82.1. In other versions, some user interfaces might look different, but this shouldn't impact the core functionality.

Begin by setting up n8n.

We recommend starting with [n8n Cloud](https://app.n8n.cloud/register), a hosted solution that doesn't require installation and includes a free trial.

If n8n Cloud isn't a good option for you, you can [self-host with Docker](../../../hosting/installation/docker/). This is an advanced option recommended only for technical users familiar with hosting services, Docker, and the command line.

For more details on the different ways to set up n8n, see our [platforms documentation](../../../choose-n8n/#platforms).

Once you have n8n running, open the Editor UI in a browser window. Log in to your n8n instance. Select **Overview** and then **Create Workflow** to view the main canvas.

It should look like this:

## Editor UI settings

The editor UI is the web interface where you build [workflows](../../../workflows/). You can access all your workflows and [credentials](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n), as well as support pages, from the Editor UI.

On the left side of the **Editor UI**, there is a panel which contains the core functionalities and settings for managing your workflows. Expand and collapse it by selecting the small arrow icon.

The panel contains the following sections:

- **Overview**: Contains all the workflows, credentials, and executions you have access to. During this course, create new workflows here.
- **Personal**: Every user gets a default personal project. If you don’t create a custom project, your workflows and credentials are stored here.
- **Projects**: Projects let you group workflows and credentials together. You can assign [roles](../../../user-management/rbac/role-types/) to users in a project to control what they can do. Projects aren’t available on the Community edition.
- **Admin Panel**: n8n Cloud only. Access your n8n instance usage, billing, and version settings.
- **Templates**: A collection of pre-made workflows. Great place to get started with common use cases.
- **Variables**: Used to store and access fixed data across your workflows. This feature is available on the Pro and Enterprise Plans.
- **Insights**: Provides analytics and insights about your workflows.
- **Help**: Contains resources around n8n product and community.
- **What’s New**: Shows the latest product updates and features.

*Editor UI left-side menu*

The top bar of the **Editor UI** contains the following information:

- **Workflow Name**: By default, n8n names a new workflow as "My workflow", but you can edit the name at any time.
- **+ Add Tag**: Tags help you organise your workflows by category, use case, or whatever is relevant for you. Tags are optional.
- **Inactive/active toggle**: This button activates or deactivates the current workflow. By default, workflows are deactivated.
- **Share**: You can share and collaborate with others on workflows on the Starter, Pro, and Enterprise plans.
- **Save**: This button saves the current workflow.
- **History**: Once you save your workflow, you can view previous versions here.

The **canvas** is the gray dotted grid background in the Editor UI. It displays several icons and a node with different functionalities:

- Buttons to zoom the canvas to fit the screen, zoom in or out of the canvas, reset zoom, and tidy up the nodes on screen.
- A button to **Execute workflow** once you add your first node. When you click on it, n8n executes all nodes on the canvas in sequence.
- A button with a **+** sign inside. This button opens the nodes panel.
- A button with a note icon inside. This button adds a [sticky note](../../../workflows/components/sticky-notes/) to the canvas (visible when hovering on the top right + icon).
- A button labeled **Ask Assistant** appears on the right side of the canvas. You can ask the AI Assistant for help with building workflows.
- A dotted square with the text "Add first step." This is where you add your first node.

You can move the workflow canvas around in three ways:

- Select `Ctrl`+`Left Button` on the canvas and move it around.
- Select `Middle Button` on the canvas and move it around.
- Place two fingers on your touchpad and slide.

Don't worry about workflow execution and activation for now; we'll explain these concepts later on in the course.

You can think of nodes as building blocks that serve different functions that, when put together, make up a functioning machine: an automated workflow.

A node is an individual step in your workflow: one that either (a) loads, (b) processes, or (c) sends data.

Based on their function, n8n classifies nodes into four types:

- **App** or **Action Nodes** add, remove, and edit data; request and send external data; and trigger events in other systems. Refer to the [Action nodes library](../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/) for a full list of these nodes.
- **Trigger Nodes** start a workflow and supply the initial data. Refer to the [Trigger nodes library](../../../integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/) for a list of trigger nodes.
- **Core Nodes** can be trigger or app nodes. Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls. Refer to the [Core Nodes library](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/) for a full list of core nodes.
- **Cluster Nodes** are node groups that work together to provide functionality in a workflow, primarily for AI workflows. Refer to [Cluster nodes](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/) for more information.

Refer to [Node types](../../../integrations/builtin/node-types/) for a more detailed explanation of all node types.

You can find all available nodes in the **nodes panel** on the right side of the Editor UI. There are three ways in which you can open the nodes panel:

- Click the **+** icon in the top right corner of the canvas.
- Click the **+** icon on the right side of an existing node on the canvas (the node to which you want to add another one).
- Click the `Tab` key on your keyboard.

In the nodes panel, notice that when adding your first node, you will see the different trigger node categories. After you have added your trigger node, you'll see that the nodes panel changes to show Advanced AI, Actions in an App, Data transformation, Flow, Core, and Human in the loop nodes.

If you want to find a specific node, use the search input at the top of the nodes panel.

There are two ways to add nodes to your canvas:

- Select the node you want in the nodes panel. The new node will automatically connect to the selected node on the canvas.
- Drag and drop the node from the nodes panel to the canvas.

If you hover on a node, you'll notice that three icons appear on top:

- Execute the node (Play icon)
- Deactivate/Activate the node (Power icon)
- Delete the node (Trash icon)

There will also be an ellipsis icon, which opens a context menu containing other [node options](../../../workflows/components/nodes/#node-controls).

To move a workflow around the canvas, select all nodes with your mouse or `Ctrl`+`A`, select and hold on a node, then drag it to any point you want on the canvas.

In this lesson you learned how to navigate the Editor UI, what the icons mean, how to access the left-side and node panels, and how to add nodes to the canvas.

In the next lesson, you will build a mini-workflow to put into practice what you've learned so far.

npm install -g n8n@next

n8n start --tunnel
```

## Reverting an upgrade

Install the older version that you want to go back to.

If the upgrade involved a database migration:

1. Check the feature documentation and release notes to see if there are any manual changes you need to make.
1. Run `n8n db:revert` on your current version to roll back the database. If you want to revert more than one database migration, you need to repeat this process.

## Windows troubleshooting

If you are experiencing issues running n8n on Windows, make sure your Node.js environment is correctly set up. Follow Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
### Next steps

Try out n8n using the [Quickstarts](../../../try-it-out/).

## Updating

To update your n8n instance to the `latest` version, run:
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
To install the `next` version:
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
## n8n with tunnel

Danger

Use this for local development and testing. It isn't safe to use it in production.

To use webhooks for trigger nodes of external services like GitHub, n8n has to be reachable from the web. n8n runs a [tunnel service](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) that can redirect requests from n8n's servers to your local n8n instance.

Start n8n with `--tunnel` by running:
```

## Allow usage of external npm modules.

**URL:** llms-txt#allow-usage-of-external-npm-modules.

export NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL=moment,lodash
```

If using Task Runners

If n8n instance is setup with [Task Runners](../../task-runners/), add the environment variables to the Task Runners instead to the main n8n node.

Refer to [Environment variables reference](../../environment-variables/nodes/) for more information on these variables.

As a Processor, n8n implements policies and practices that secure the personal data you send to the platform, and includes a [Data Processing Agreement](https://n8n.io/legal/#data) as part of the company's standard [Terms of Service](https://n8n.io/legal/#terms).

The n8n Data Processing Agreement includes the [Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en). These clarify how n8n handles your data, and they update n8n's GDPR policies to cover the latest standards set by the European Commission.

You can find a list of n8n sub-processors [here](#sub-processors).

For self-hosted versions, n8n is neither a Controller nor a Processor, as we don't manage your data

### Submitting an account deletion request

### GDPR for self-hosted users

If you self-host n8n, you are responsible for deleting user data. If you need to delete data on behalf of one of your users, you can delete the respective execution. n8n recommends configuring n8n to prune execution data automatically every few days to avoid effortful GDPR request handling as much as possible. Configure this using the `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` environment variable. Refer to [Environment variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for more information.

n8n collects selected usage and performance data to help diagnose problems and improve the platform. Read about how n8n stores and processes this information in the [privacy policy](https://n8n.io/legal/#privacy).

The data gathered is different in self-hosted n8n and n8n Cloud.

### Data collection in self-hosted n8n

n8n takes care to keep self-hosted data anonymous and avoids collecting sensitive data.

#### What n8n collects

- Error codes and messages of failed executions (excluding any payload data, and not for custom nodes)
- Error reports for app crashes and API issues
- The graph of a workflow (types of nodes used and how they're connected)
- From node parameters:
  - The 'resource' and 'operation' that a node is set to (if applicable)
  - For HTTP request nodes, the domain, path, and method (with personal data anonymized)
- Data around workflow executions:
  - Status
  - The user ID of the user who ran the execution
  - The first time a workflow loads data from an external source
  - The first successful production (non-manual) workflow execution
- The domain of webhook calls, if specified (excluding subdomain).
- Details on how the UI is used (for example, navigation, nodes panel searches)
- Diagnostic information:
  - n8n version
  - Selected settings:
    - DB_TYPE
    - N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED
    - N8N_DISABLE_PRODUCTION_MAIN_PROCESS
    - [Execution variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/executions/)
  - OS, RAM, and CPUs
  - Anonymous instance ID
- IP address

#### What n8n doesn't collect

n8n doesn't collect private or sensitive information, such as:

- Personally identifiable information (except IP address)
- Credential information
- Node parameters (except 'resource' and 'operation')
- Execution data
- Sensitive settings (for example, endpoints, ports, DB connections, username/password)
- Error payloads

#### How collection works

Most data is sent to n8n as events that generate it occur. Workflow execution counts and an instance pulse are sent periodically (every 6 hours).

#### Opting out of telemetry

Telemetry collection is enabled by default. To disable it you can configure the following environment variables.

To opt out of telemetry events:

To opt out of checking for new versions of n8n:

To disable the templates feature (prevents background health check calls):

See [configuration](../../hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) for more info on how to set environment variables.

### Data collection in n8n Cloud

n8n Cloud collects everything listed in [Data collection in self-hosted n8n](#data-collection-in-self-hosted-n8n).

Additionally, in n8n Cloud, n8n uses [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) to track events and visualise usage, including using session recordings. Session recordings comprise the data seen by a user on screen, with the exception of credential values. n8n's product team uses this data to improve the product. All recordings are deleted after 21 days.

To provide enhanced assistance, n8n integrates AI-powered features that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs).

To assist and improve user experience, n8n may send specific context data to LLMs. This context data is strictly limited to information about the current workflow. n8n does not send any values from credential fields or actual output data to AI services. The data will not be incorporated, used, or retained to train the models of the AI services. Any data will be deleted after 30 days.

#### When n8n shares data

Data is only sent to AI services if workspaces have opted in to use the assistant. The Assistant is enabled by default for n8n Cloud users. When a workspace opts in to use the assistant, node-specific data is transmitted only during direct interactions and active sessions with the AI assistant, ensuring no unnecessary data sharing occurs.

- **General Workflow Information**: This includes details about which nodes are present in your workflow, the number of items currently in the workflow, and whether the workflow is active.
- **Input & Output Schemas of Nodes**: This includes the schema of all nodes with incoming data and the output schema of a node in question. We do not send the actual data value of the schema.
- **Node Configuration**: This includes the operations, options, and settings chosen in the referenced node.
- **Code and Expressions**: This includes any code or expressions in the node in question to help with debugging potential issues and optimizations.

#### What n8n doesn't share

- **Credentials**: Any values of the credential fields of your nodes.
- **Output Data**: The actual data processed by your workflows.
- **Sensitive Information**: Any personally identifiable information or other sensitive data that could compromise your privacy or security that you have not explicitly mentioned in node parameters or your code of a [Code Node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).

### Documentation telemetry

n8n's documentation (this website) uses cookies to recognize your repeated visits and preferences, as well as to measure the effectiveness of n8n's documentation and whether users find what they're searching for. With your consent, you're helping n8n to make our documentation better. You can control cookie consent using the cookie widget.

## Retention and deletion of personal identifiable data

PID (personal identifiable data) is data that's personal to you and would identify you as an individual.

n8n only retains data for as long as necessary to provide the core service.

For n8n Cloud, n8n stores your workflow code, credentials, and other data indefinitely, until you choose to delete it or close your account. The platform stores execution data according to the retention rules on your account.

n8n deletes most internal application logs and logs tied to subprocessors within 90 days. The company retains a subset of logs for longer periods where required for security investigations.

If you choose to delete your n8n account, n8n deletes all customer data and event data associated with your account. n8n deletes customer data in backups within 90 days.

Self-hosted users should have their own PID policy and data deletion processes. Refer to [What you can do](../what-you-can-do/) for more information.

n8n uses Paddle.com to process payments. When you sign up for a paid plan, Paddle transmits and stores the details of your payment method according to their security policy. n8n stores no information about your payment method.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
export N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
export N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
export N8N_TEMPLATES_ENABLED=false
```

## License environment variables

**URL:** llms-txt#license-environment-variables

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

To enable certain licensed features, you must first activate your license. You can do this either through the UI or by setting environment variables. For more information, see [license key](../../../../license-key/).

## Google: OAuth2 single service

**URL:** llms-txt#google:-oauth2-single-service

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Set up OAuth
  - Create a Google Cloud Console project
  - Enable APIs
  - Configure your OAuth consent screen
  - Create your Google OAuth client credentials
  - Finish your n8n credential
- Video
- Troubleshooting
  - Google hasn't verified this app

This document contains instructions for creating a Google credential for a single service. They're also available as a [video](#video).

Note for n8n Cloud users

For the following nodes, you can authenticate by selecting **Sign in with Google** in the OAuth section:

- [Google Calendar](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlecalendar/)
- [Google Contacts](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlecontacts/)
- [Google Drive](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrive/)
- [Google Mail](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/)
- [Google Sheets](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/)
- [Google Sheets Trigger](../../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheetstrigger/)
- [Google Tasks](../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googletasks/)

- Create a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) account.

There are five steps to connecting your n8n credential to Google services:

1. [Create a Google Cloud Console project](#create-a-google-cloud-console-project).
1. [Enable APIs](#enable-apis).
1. [Configure your OAuth consent screen](#configure-your-oauth-consent-screen).
1. [Create your Google OAuth client credentials](#create-your-google-oauth-client-credentials).
1. [Finish your n8n credential](#finish-your-n8n-credential).

### Create a Google Cloud Console project

First, create a Google Cloud Console project. If you already have a project, jump to the [next section](#enable-apis):

1. Log in to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) using your Google credentials.

1. In the top menu, select the project dropdown in the top navigation and select **New project** or go directly to the [New Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) page.

1. Enter a **Project name** and select the **Location** for your project.

1. Select **Create**.

1. Check the top navigation and make sure the project dropdown has your project selected. If not, select the project you just created.

Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

With your project created, enable the APIs you'll need access to:

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.

Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

1. Go to **APIs & Services > Library**.

1. Search for and select the API(s) you want to enable. For example, for the Gmail node, search for and enable the Gmail API.

1. Some integrations require other APIs or require you to request access:

- Google Perspective: [Request API Access](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-get-started).
   - Google Ads: Get a [Developer Token](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token).

Google Drive API required

The following integrations require the Google Drive API, as well as their own API:

- Google Docs
   - Google Sheets
   - Google Slides

In addition to the Vertex AI API you will also need to enable the [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/).

1. Select **ENABLE**.

### Configure your OAuth consent screen

If you haven't used OAuth in your Google Cloud project before, you'll need to [configure the OAuth consent screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent):

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.

Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

1. Open the left navigation menu and go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**. Google will redirect you to the Google Auth Platform overview page.

1. Select **Get started** on the **Overview** tab to begin configuring OAuth consent.

1. Enter an **App name** and **User support email** to include on the Oauth screen. Select **Next** to continue.

1. For the **Audience**, select **Internal** for user access within your organization's Google workspace or **External** for any user with a Google account. Refer to Google's [User type documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549945?sjid=17061891731152303663-EU#user-type) for more information on user types. Select **Next** to continue.

1. Select the **Email addresses** Google should use to contact you about changes to your project. Select **Next** to continue.

1. Read and accept the Google's User Data Policy. Select **Continue** and then select **Create**.

1. In the left-hand menu, select **Branding**.

1. In the **Authorized domains** section, select **Add domain**:

- If you're using n8n's Cloud service, add `n8n.cloud`
   - If you're [self-hosting](../../../../../hosting/), add the domain of your n8n instance.

1. Select **Save** at the bottom of the page.

### Create your Google OAuth client credentials

Next, create the OAuth client credentials in Google:

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Make sure you're in the correct project.
1. In the **APIs & Services** section, select [**Credentials**](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
1. Select **+ Create credentials** > **OAuth client ID**.
1. In the **Application type** dropdown, select **Web application**.
1. Google automatically generates a **Name**. Update the **Name** to something you'll recognize in your console.
1. From your n8n credential, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**. Paste it into the **Authorized redirect URIs** in Google Console.
1. Select **Create**.

### Finish your n8n credential

With the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential:

1. From Google's **OAuth client created** modal, copy the **Client ID**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
1. From the same Google modal, copy the **Client Secret**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
1. In n8n, select **Sign in with Google** to complete your Google authentication.
1. **Save** your new credentials.

### Google hasn't verified this app

If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning **Google hasn't verified this app**. To avoid this:

- If your app **User Type** is **Internal**, create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate.
- If your app **User Type** is **External**, you can add your email to the list of testers for the app: go to the [**Audience**](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience) page and add the email you're signing in with to the list of **Test users**.

If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in [Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/reference/errors/authorization#google_hasnt_verified_this_app).

### Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized

For Google Cloud apps with **Publishing status** set to **Testing** and **User type** set to **External**, consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to [Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615?hl=en#zippy=%2Ctesting) for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal.

## Let AI specify the tool parameters

**URL:** llms-txt#let-ai-specify-the-tool-parameters

**Contents:**
- Let the model fill in the parameter
- Use the `$fromAI()` function
  - Parameters
  - Examples
  - Templates

When configuring [tools](../../../glossary/#ai-tool) connected to the Tools Agent, many parameters can be filled in by the AI model itself. The AI model will use the context from the task and information from other connected tools to fill in the appropriate details.

There are two ways to do this, and you can switch between them.

## Let the model fill in the parameter

Each appropriate parameter field in the tool's editing dialog has an extra button at the end:

On activating this button, the [AI Agent](../../../glossary/#ai-agent) will fill in the expression for you, with no need for any further user input. The field itself is filled in with a message indicating that the parameter has been defined automatically by the model.

If you want to define the parameter yourself, click on the 'X' in this box to revert to user-defined values. Note that the 'expression' field will now contain the expression generated by this feature, though you can now edit it further to add extra details as described in the following section.

Activating this feature will overwrite any manual definition you may have already added.

## Use the `$fromAI()` function

The `$fromAI()` function uses AI to dynamically fill in parameters for tools connected to the [Tools AI agent](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/).

The `$fromAI()` function is only available for tools connected to the AI Agent node. The `$fromAI()` function doesn't work with the [Code](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode/) tool or with [other non-tool cluster sub-nodes](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/).

To use the `$fromAI()` function, call it with the required `key` parameter:

The `key` parameter and other arguments to the `$fromAI()` function aren't references to existing values. Instead, think of these arguments as hints that the AI model will use to populate the right data.

For instance, if you choose a key called `email`, the AI Model will look for an email address in its context, other tools, and input data. In chat workflows, it may ask the user for an email address if it can't find one elsewhere. You can optionally pass other parameters like `description` to give extra context to the AI model.

The `$fromAI()` function accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter      | Type   | Required? | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `key`          | string |           | A string representing the key or name of the argument. This must be between 1 and 64 characters in length and can only contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. |
| `description`  | string |           | A string describing the argument.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `type`         | string |           | A string specifying the data type. Can be string, number, boolean, or json (defaults to string).                                                                                                        |
| `defaultValue` | any    |           | The default value to use for the argument.                                                                                                                                                              |

As an example, you could use the following `$fromAI()` expression to dynamically populate a field with a name:

If you don't need the optional parameters, you could simplify this as:

To dynamically populate the number of items you have in stock, you could use a `$fromAI()` expression like this:

If you only want to fill in parts of a field with a dynamic value from the model, you can use it in a normal expression as well. For example, if you want the model to fill out the `subject` parameter for an e-mail, but always pre-fix the generated value with the string 'Generated by AI:', you could use the following expression:

You can see the `$fromAI()` function in action in the following [templates](../../../glossary/#template-n8n):

- [Angie, Personal AI Assistant with Telegram Voice and Text](https://n8n.io/workflows/2462-angie-personal-ai-assistant-with-telegram-voice-and-text/)

Use the Aggregate node to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.

To begin using the node, select the **Aggregate** you'd like to use:

- [**Individual Fields**](#individual-fields): Aggregate individual fields separately.
- [**All Item Data**](#all-item-data): Aggregate all item data into a single list.

### Individual Fields

- **Input Field Name**: Enter the name of the field in the input data to aggregate together.
- **Rename Field**: This toggle controls whether to give the field a different name in the aggregated output data. Turn this on to add a different field name. If you're aggregating multiple fields, you must provide new output field names. You can't leave multiple fields undefined.
  - **Output Field Name**: This field is displayed when you turn on **Rename Field**. Enter the field name for the aggregated output data.

Refer to [Node options](#node-options) for more configuration options.

- **Put Output in Field**: Enter the name of the field to output the data in.
- **Include**: Select which fields to include in the output. Choose from:
  - **All fields**: The output includes data from all fields with no further parameters.
  - **Specified Fields**: If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should include data from in the **Fields To Include** parameter. The output will include only the fields in this list.
  - **All Fields Except**: If you select this option, enter a comma-separated list of fields the output should exclude data from in the **Fields To Exclude** parameter. The output will include all fields not in this list.

Refer to [Node options](#node-options) for more configuration options.

You can further configure this node using these **Options**:

- **Disable Dot Notation**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. It controls whether to disallow referencing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name (turned on), or allow it (turned off, default).
- **Merge Lists**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. Turn it on if the field to aggregate is a list and you want to output a single flat list rather than a list of lists.
- **Include Binaries**: The node displays this toggle for both Aggregate types. Turn it on if you want to include binary data from the input in the new output.
- **Keep Missing And Null Values**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. Turn it on to add a null (empty) entry in the output list when there is a null or missing value in the input. If turned off, the output ignores null or empty values.

## Credentials file

**URL:** llms-txt#credentials-file

**Contents:**
- Structure of the credentials file
  - Outline structure
- Parameters
  - `name`
  - `displayName`
  - `documentationUrl`
  - `properties`
  - `authenticate`
  - `test`

The credentials file defines the authorization methods for the node. The settings in this file affect what n8n displays in the **Credentials** modal, and must reflect the authentication requirements of the service you're connecting to.

In the credentials file, you can use all the [n8n UI elements](../ui-elements/). n8n encrypts the data that's stored using credentials using an encryption key.

## Structure of the credentials file

The credentials file follows this basic structure:

1. Import statements
1. Create a class for the credentials
1. Within the class, define the properties that control authentication for the node.

### Outline structure

String. The internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.

String. The name n8n uses in the GUI.

### `documentationUrl`

String. URL to your credentials documentation.

Each object contains:

- `displayName`: the name n8n uses in the GUI.
- `name`: the internal name of the object. Used to reference it from other places in the node.
- `type`: the data type expected, such as `string`.
- `default`: the URL that n8n should use to test credentials.

- `authenticate`: Object. Contains objects that tell n8n how to inject the authentication data as part of the API request.

String. If you're using an authentication method that sends data in the header, body, or query string, set this to `'generic'`.

Object. Defines the authentication methods. Options are:

- `body`: Object. Sends authentication data in the request body. Can contain nested objects.

## HTTP Request credentials

**URL:** llms-txt#http-request-credentials

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Supported authentication methods
- Using predefined credential type
- Using basic auth
- Using digest auth
- Using header auth
- Using bearer auth
- Using OAuth1
- Using OAuth2
  - Authorization Code grant type

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [HTTP Request](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)
- [HTTP Request Tool (legacy)](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/)

You must use the authentication method required by the app or service you want to query.

If you need to secure the authentication with an SSL certificate, refer to [Provide an SSL certificate](#provide-an-ssl-certificate) for the information you'll need.

## Supported authentication methods

- Predefined credential type
- Basic auth (generic credential type)
- Custom auth (generic credential type)
- Digest auth (generic credential type)
- Header auth (generic credential type)
- Bearer auth (generic credential type)
- OAuth1 (generic credential type)
- OAuth2 (generic credential type)
- Query auth (generic credential type)

Refer to [HTTP authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication) for more information relating to generic credential types.

Predefined credential types

n8n recommends using predefined credential types whenever there's a credential type available for the service you want to connect to. It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.

You can use [Predefined credential types](../../../custom-operations/#predefined-credential-types) to perform custom operations with some APIs where n8n has a node for the platform. For example, n8n has an Asana node, and supports using your Asana credentials in the HTTP Request node. Refer to [Custom operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

## Using predefined credential type

To use a predefined credential type:

1. Open your HTTP Request node, or add a new one to your workflow.
1. In **Authentication**, select **Predefined Credential Type**.
1. In **Credential Type**, select the API you want to use.
1. In **Credential for `<API name>`**, you can:
   1. Select an existing credential for that platform, if available.
   1. Select **Create New** to create a new credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports basic authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

- The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting
- The **Password** that goes with that username

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports digest authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

- The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting
- The **Password** that goes with that username

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports header authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

- The header **Name** you need to pass to the app or service your HTTP request is targeting
- The **Value** for the header

Read more about [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers#authentication)

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports bearer authentication. This authentication type is actually just header authentication with the `Name` set to `Authorization` and the `Value` set to `Bearer <token>`.

To configure this credential, enter:

- The **Bearer Token** you need to pass to the app or service your HTTP request is targeting

Read more about [bearer authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/authentication/bearer-authentication/).

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth1 authentication.

To configure this credential, enter:

- An **Authorization URL**: Also known as the Resource Owner Authorization URI. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/authorize`. The temporary credentials are sent here to prompt a user to complete authorization.
- An **Access Token URL**: This is the URI used for the initial request for temporary credentials. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/request` or `/oauth1/token`.
- A **Consumer Key**: Also known as the client key, like a username. This specifies the `oauth_consumer_key` to use for the call.
- A **Consumer Secret**: Also known as the client secret, like a password.
- A **Request Token URL**: This is the URI used to switch from temporary credentials to long-lived credentials after authorization. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/access`.
- Select the **Signature Method** the auth handshake uses. This specifies the `oauth_signature_method` to use for the call. Options include:
  - **HMAC-SHA1**
  - **HMAC-SHA256**
  - **HMAC-SHA512**

For most OAuth1 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration to generate the values for most of these fields. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.

Read more about [OAuth1](https://oauth.net/1/) and the [OAuth1 authorization flow](https://oauth1.wp-api.org/docs/basics/Auth-Flow.html).

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth2 authentication.

Requirements to configure this credential depend on the **Grant Type** selected. Refer to [OAuth Grant Types](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/) for more information on each grant type.

For most OAuth2 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.

Read more about [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/).

### Authorization Code grant type

Use Authorization Code grant type to exchange an authorization code for an access token. The auth flow uses the redirect URL to return the user to the client. Then the application gets the authorization code from the URL and uses it to request an access token. Refer to [Authorization Code Request](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/) for more information.

To configure this credential, select **Authorization Code** as the **Grant Type**.

- An **Authorization URL**
- An **Access Token URL**
- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to log in with.
- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in with.
- *Optional:* Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.
- *Optional:* Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.
- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
  - **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
  - **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.
- *Optional:* Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

### Client Credentials grant type

Use the Client Credentials grant type when applications request an access token to access their own resources, not on behalf of a user. Refer to [Client Credentials](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/) for more information.

To configure this credential, select **Client Credentials** as the **Grant Type**.

- An **Access Token URL**: The URL to hit to begin the OAuth2 flow. Typically this URL ends in `/token`.
- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to use to log in to the client.
- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in to the client.
- *Optional:* Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. Most services don't support scopes for Client Credentials grant types; only enter scopes here if yours does.
- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
  - **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
  - **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.
- *Optional:* Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) grant type is an extension to the Authorization Code flow to prevent CSRF and authorization code injection attacks.

To configure this credential, select **PKCE** as the **Grant Type**.

- An **Authorization URL**
- An **Access Token URL**
- A **Client ID**: The ID or username to log in with.
- A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in with.
- *Optional:* Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.
- *Optional:* Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.
- An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:
  - **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.
  - **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.
- *Optional:* Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as a single key/value query parameter. (For multiple query parameters, use [Custom Auth](#using-custom-auth).)

To configure this credential, enter:

- A query parameter key or **Name**
- A query parameter **Value**

Use this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as multiple key/value query parameters or you need more flexibility than the other generic auth options.

The **Custom Auth** credential expects JSON data to define your credential. You can use `headers`, `qs`, `body` or a mix. Review the examples below to get started.

### Sending two headers

### Sending header and query string

## Provide an SSL certificate

You can send an SSL certificate with your HTTP request. Create the SSL certificate as a separate credential for use by the node:

1. In the HTTP Request node **Settings**, turn on **SSL Certificates**.
1. On the **Parameters** tab, add an existing SSL Certificate credential to **Credential for SSL Certificates** or create a new one.

To configure your SSL Certificates credential, you'll need to add:

- The Certificate Authority **CA** bundle
- The **Certificate** (CRT): May also appear as a Public Key, depending on who your issuing CA was and how they format the cert
- The **Private Key** (KEY)
- *Optional:* If the **Private Key** is encrypted, enter a **Passphrase** for the private key.

If your SSL certificate is in a single file (such as a `.pfx` file), you'll need to open the file to copy details from it to paste into the appropriate fields:

- Enter the Public Key/CRT as the **Certificate**
- Enter the **Private Key**/KEY in that field

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
{
	"headers": {
		"X-AUTH-USERNAME": "username",
		"X-AUTH-PASSWORD": "password"
	}
}
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
{
	 "body" : {
		"user": "username",
		"pass": "password"
	}
}
```

		"appid": "123456",
		"apikey": "my-api-key"
	}
}
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
{
	"headers": {
		"api-version": "202404"
	},
	"qs": {
		"apikey": "my-api-key"
	}
}
```

## Credentials

**URL:** llms-txt#credentials

[Credentials](../glossary/#credential-n8n) are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node.

Access the credentials UI by opening the left menu and selecting **Credentials**. n8n lists credentials you created on the **My credentials** tab. The **All credentials** tab shows all credentials you can use, included credentials shared with you by other users.

- [Create and edit credentials](add-edit-credentials/).
- Learn about [credential sharing](credential-sharing/).
- Find information on setting up credentials for your services in the [credentials library](../integrations/builtin/credentials/).

## Transforming data

**URL:** llms-txt#transforming-data

n8n uses a predefined [data structure](../data-structure/) that allows all nodes to process incoming data correctly.

Your incoming data may have a different data structure, in which case you will need to transform it to allow each item to be processed individually.

For example, the image below shows the output of an [HTTP Request](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node that returns data incompatible with n8n's data structure. The node returns the data and displays that only one item was returned.

To transform this kind of structure into the n8n data structure you can use the data transformation nodes:

- [Aggregate](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.
- [Limit](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.limit/): remove items beyond a defined maximum number.
- [Remove Duplicates](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/): identify and delete items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.
- [Sort](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/): organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.
- [Split Out](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/): separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.
- [Summarize](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.summarize/): aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.

## Query JSON with JMESPath

**URL:** llms-txt#query-json-with-jmespath

**Contents:**
- The `jmespath()` method
- Common tasks
  - Apply a JMESPath expression to a collection of elements with projections
  - Select multiple elements and create a new list or object
  - An alternative to arrow functions in expressions

[JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) is a query language for JSON that you can use to extract and transform elements from a JSON document. For full details of how to use JMESPath, refer to the [JMESPath documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html).

## The `jmespath()` method

n8n provides a custom method, `jmespath()`. Use this method to perform a search on a JSON object using the JMESPath query language.

To help understand what the method does, here is the equivalent longer JavaScript:

Expressions must be single-line

The longer code example doesn't work in Expressions, as they must be single-line.

`object` is a JSON object, such as the output of a previous node. `searchString` is an expression written in the JMESPath query language. The [JMESPath Specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#jmespath-specification) provides a list of supported expressions, while their [Tutorial](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html) and [Examples](https://jmespath.org/examples.html) provide interactive examples.

Search parameter order

The examples in the [JMESPath Specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#jmespath-specification) follow the pattern `search(searchString, object)`. The [JMESPath JavaScript library](https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.js/), which n8n uses, supports `search(object, searchString)` instead. This means that when using examples from the JMESPath documentation, you may need to change the order of the search function parameters.

This section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in [JMESPath's own documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html).

When trying out these examples, you need to set the Code node **Mode** to **Run Once for Each Item**.

### Apply a JMESPath expression to a collection of elements with projections

From the [JMESPath projections documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#projections):

> Projections are one of the key features of JMESPath. Use it to apply an expression to a collection of elements. JMESPath supports five kinds of projections:
>
> - List Projections
> - Slice Projections
> - Object Projections
> - Flatten Projections
> - Filter Projections

The following example shows basic usage of list, slice, and object projections. Refer to the [JMESPath projections documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#projections) for detailed explanations of each projection type, and more examples.

Given this JSON from a webhook node:

Retrieve a [list](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#list-and-slice-projections) of all the people's first names:

Get a [slice](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#list-and-slice-projections) of the first names:

Get a list of the dogs' ages using [object projections](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#object-projections):

### Select multiple elements and create a new list or object

Use [Multiselect](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#multiselect) to select elements from a JSON object and combine them into a new list or object.

Given this JSON from a webhook node:

Use multiselect list to get the first and last names and create new lists containing both names:

### An alternative to arrow functions in expressions

For example, generate some input data by returning the below code from the Code node:

You could do a search like "find the item with the name Lenovo and tell me their category ID."

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
$jmespath(object, searchString)
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
_jmespath(object, searchString)
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
var jmespath = require('jmespath');
jmespath.search(object, searchString);
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
[
  {
    "headers": {
      "host": "n8n.instance.address",
      ...
    },
    "params": {},

## Supported authentication methods

n8n used to support an **OAuth** authentication method, which used X's [OAuth 1.0a](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a) authentication method. n8n deprecated this method with the release of V2 of the X node in n8n version [0.236.0](../../../../release-notes/0-x/#n8n02360).

Refer to [X's API documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api) for more information about the service. Refer to [X's API authentication documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/overview) for more information about authenticating with the service.

Refer to [Application-only Authentication](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only) for more information about app-only authentication.

Use this method if you're using n8n version 0.236.0 or later.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**
- A **Client Secret**

To generate your Client ID and Client Secret:

1. In the Twitter [developer portal](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard), open your project.
1. On the project's **Overview** tab, find the **Apps** section and select **Add App**.
1. Give your app a **Name** and select **Next**.
1. Go to the **App Settings**.
1. In the **User authentication settings**, select **Set Up**.

1. Save your changes.
1. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** displayed in X and add them to the corresponding fields in your n8n credential.

Refer to X's [OAuth 2.0 Authentication documentation](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0) for more information on working with this authentication method.

This credential uses the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token authentication method, so you'll be subject to app rate limits. Refer to [X rate limits](#x-rate-limits) below for more information.

X has time-based rate limits per endpoint based on your developer access plan level. X calculates app rate limits and user rate limits independently. Refer to [Rate limits](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) for the access plan level rate limits and guidance on avoiding hitting them.

Use the guidance below for calculating rate limits:

- If you're using the deprecated OAuth method, user rate limits apply. You'll have one limit per time window for each set of users' access tokens.
- If you're [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2), app rate limits apply. You'll have a limit per time window for requests made by your app.

X calculates user rate limits and app rate limits independently.

Refer to X's [Rate limits and authentication methods](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits#auth) for more information about these rate limit types.

## Set a custom encryption key

**URL:** llms-txt#set-a-custom-encryption-key

n8n creates a random encryption key automatically on the first launch and saves it in the `~/.n8n` folder. n8n uses that key to encrypt the credentials before they get saved to the database. If the key isn't yet in the settings file, you can set it using an environment variable, so that n8n uses your custom key instead of generating a new one.

In [queue mode](../../../scaling/queue-mode/), you must specify the encryption key environment variable for all workers.

Refer to [Environment variables reference](../../environment-variables/deployment/) for more information on this variable.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
export N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<SOME RANDOM STRING>

## Google: Service Account

**URL:** llms-txt#google:-service-account

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Set up Service Account
  - Create a Google Cloud Console project
  - Enable APIs
  - Set up Google Cloud Service Account
  - Finish your n8n credential
- Video
- Troubleshooting
  - Service Account can't access Google Drive files
  - Enable domain-wide delegation

Using service accounts is more complex than OAuth2. Before you begin:

- Check if your node is [compatible](../#compatible-nodes) with Service Account.
- Make sure you need to use Service Account. For most use cases, [OAuth2](../oauth-single-service/) is a better option.
- Read the Google documentation on [Creating and managing service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts).

- Create a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) account.

## Set up Service Account

There are four steps to connecting your n8n credential to a Google Service Account:

1. [Create a Google Cloud Console project](#create-a-google-cloud-console-project).
1. [Enable APIs](#enable-apis).
1. [Set up Google Cloud Service Account](#set-up-google-cloud-service-account).
1. [Finish your n8n credential](#finish-your-n8n-credential).

### Create a Google Cloud Console project

First, create a Google Cloud Console project. If you already have a project, jump to the next section:

1. Log in to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) using your Google credentials.

1. In the top menu, select the project dropdown in the top navigation and select **New project** or go directly to the [New Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) page.

1. Enter a **Project name** and select the **Location** for your project.

1. Select **Create**.

1. Check the top navigation and make sure the project dropdown has your project selected. If not, select the project you just created.

Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

With your project created, enable the APIs you'll need access to:

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.

Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

1. Go to **APIs & Services > Library**.

1. Search for and select the API(s) you want to enable. For example, for the Gmail node, search for and enable the Gmail API.

1. Some integrations require other APIs or require you to request access:

- Google Perspective: [Request API Access](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-get-started).
   - Google Ads: Get a [Developer Token](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token).

Google Drive API required

The following integrations require the Google Drive API, as well as their own API:

- Google Docs
   - Google Sheets
   - Google Slides

In addition to the Vertex AI API you will also need to enable the [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/).

1. Select **ENABLE**.

### Set up Google Cloud Service Account

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.

Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation

1. Open the left navigation menu and go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**. Google takes you to your **Credentials** page.

1. Select **+ Create credentials > Service account**.

1. Enter a name in **Service account name** and an ID in **Service account ID**. Refer to [Creating a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts?hl=en#creating) for more information.

1. Select **Create and continue**.

1. Based on your use-case, you may want to **Select a role** and **Grant users access to this service account** using the corresponding sections.

1. Select your newly created service account under the **Service Accounts** section. Open the **Keys** tab.

1. Select **Add key > Create new key**.

1. In the modal that appears, select **JSON**, then select **CREATE**. Google saves the file to your computer.

### Finish your n8n credential

With the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential:

1. Open the downloaded JSON file.

1. Copy the `client_email` and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Service Account Email**.

1. Copy the `private_key`. Don't include the surrounding `"` marks. Enter this as the **Private Key** in your n8n credential.

Older versions of n8n

If you're running an n8n version older than 0.156.0, replace all instances of `\n` in the JSON file with new lines.

1. **Optional**: Choose if you want to [**Impersonate a User**](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#delegatingauthority) (turned on).

1. To use this option, you must [Enable domain-wide delegation](#enable-domain-wide-delegation) for the service account as a Google Workspace super admin.
   1. Enter the **Email** of the user you want to impersonate.

1. If you plan to use this credential with the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node, turn on **Set up for use in HTTP Request node**.

1. With this setting turned on, you'll need to add **Scope(s)** for the node. n8n prepopulates some scopes. Refer to [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) for more information.

1. **Save** your credentials.

### Service Account can't access Google Drive files

No access to my drive

Google no longer allows Service Accounts created after April 15, 2025 to access `my drive`. Service Accounts now only have access to shared drives.

While not recommended, if you need to use a Service Account to access `my drive`, you can do so by [enabling domain-wide delegation](#enable-domain-wide-delegation). You can learn more in [this post in the community](https://community.n8n.io/t/please-please-help-upload-file-google-drive-node-with-service-account-not-working/147750/15).

A Service Account can't access Google Drive files and folders that weren't shared with its associated user email.

1. Access your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and copy your Service Account email.
1. Access your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) and go to the designated file or folder.
1. Right-click on the file or folder and select **Share**.
1. Paste your Service Account email into **Add People and groups**.
1. Select **Editor** for read-write access or **Viewer** for read-only access.

### Enable domain-wide delegation

To impersonate a user with a service account, you must enable domain-wide delegation for the service account.

Google recommends you [avoid using domain-wide delegation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-service-accounts#domain-wide-delegation), as it allows impersonation of any user (including super admins) and can pose a security risk.

To delegate domain-wide authority to a service account, you must be a super administrator for the Google Workspace domain. Then:

1. From your Google Workspace domain's [Admin console](https://admin.google.com/), select the hamburger menu, then select **Security > Access and data control > API Controls**.
1. In the **Domain wide delegation** pane, select **Manage Domain Wide Delegation**.
1. Select **Add new**.
1. In the **Client ID** field, enter the service account's **Client ID**. To get the Client ID:
   - Open your Google Cloud Console project, then open the [Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) page.
   - Copy the **OAuth 2 Client ID** and use this as the **Client ID** for the **Domain Wide Delegation**.
1. In the **OAuth scopes** field, enter a list of comma-separate scopes to grant your application access. For example, if your application needs domain-wide full access to the Google Drive API and the Google Calendar API, enter: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`.
1. Select **Authorize**.

It can take from 5 minutes up to 24 hours before you can impersonate all users in your Workspace.

## Supported authentication methods

Refer to [Microsoft Entra ID's documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/azure-active-directory) for more information about the service.

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

For self-hosted users, there are two main steps to configure OAuth2 from scratch:

1. [Register an application](#register-an-application) with the Microsoft Identity Platform.
1. [Generate a client secret](#generate-a-client-secret) for that application.

Follow the detailed instructions for each step below. For more detail on the Microsoft OAuth2 web flow, refer to [Microsoft authentication and authorization basics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts).

### Register an application

Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform:

1. Open the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://aka.ms/appregistrations).
1. Select **Register an application**.
1. Enter a **Name** for your app.
1. In **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multi-tenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Skype, Xbox)**.
1. In **Register an application**:
   1. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from your n8n credential.
   1. Paste it into the **Redirect URI (optional)** field.
   1. Select **Select a platform** > **Web**.
1. Select **Register** to finish creating your application.
1. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and paste it into n8n as the **Client ID**.

Refer to [Register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2) for more information.

### Generate a client secret

With your application created, generate a client secret for it:

1. On your Microsoft application page, select **Certificates & secrets** in the left navigation.
1. In **Client secrets**, select **+ New client secret**.
1. Enter a **Description** for your client secret, such as `n8n credential`.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Copy the **Secret** in the **Value** column.
1. Paste it into n8n as the **Client Secret**.
1. Select **Connect my account** in n8n to finish setting up the connection.
1. Log in to your Microsoft account and allow the app to access your info.

Refer to Microsoft's [Add credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#add-credentials) for more information on adding a client secret.

## Setting custom scopes

Microsoft Entra ID credentials use the following scopes by default:

- [`openid`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#the-openid-scope)
- [`offline_access`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc#the-offline_access-scope)
- [`AccessReview.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#accessreviewreadwriteall)
- [`Directory.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#directoryreadwriteall)
- [`NetworkAccessPolicy.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#networkaccesspolicyreadwriteall)
- [`DelegatedAdminRelationship.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#delegatedadminrelationshipreadwriteall)
- [`EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#entitlementmanagementreadwriteall)
- [`User.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#userreadwriteall)
- [`Directory.AccessAsUser.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#directoryaccessasuserall)
- [`Sites.FullControl.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#sitesfullcontrolall)
- [`GroupMember.ReadWrite.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#groupmemberreadwriteall)

To select different scopes for your credentials, enable the **Custom Scopes** slider and edit the **Enabled Scopes** list. Keep in mind that some features may not work as expected with more restrictive scopes.

Here are the known common errors and issues with Microsoft Entra credentials.

### Need admin approval

When attempting to add credentials for a Microsoft360 or Microsoft Entra account, users may see a message when following the procedure that this action requires admin approval.

This message will appear when the account attempting to grant permissions for the credential is managed by a Microsoft Entra. In order to issue the credential, the administrator account needs to grant permission to the user (or "tenant") for that application.

The procedure for this is covered in the [Microsoft Entra documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/grant-admin-consent).

## Create and edit credentials

**URL:** llms-txt#create-and-edit-credentials

**Contents:**
- Create a credential
- Expressions in credentials
  - Example workflow

Credentials are securely stored authentication information used to connect n8n workflows to external services such as APIs, or databases.

## Create a credential

1. Select the  **Create** button in the upper-left corner of the side menu. Select credential.
1. If your n8n instance supports [projects](../../glossary/#project-n8n), you'll also need to choose whether to create the credential inside your personal space or a specific project you have access to. If you're using the community version, you'll create the credential inside your personal space.
1. Select the app or service you wish to connect to.

1. Using the **Create** button in the upper-right corner from either the **Overview** page or a specific project. Select Credential.
1. If you're doing this from the **Overview** page, you'll create the credential inside your personal space. If you're doing this from inside a project, you'll create the credential inside that specific project.
1. Select the app or service you wish to connect to.

You can also create new credential in the credential drop down when editing a node on the workflow editor.

Once in the credential modal, enter the details required by your service. Refer to your service's page in the [credentials library](../../integrations/builtin/credentials/) for guidance.

When you save a credential, n8n tests it to confirm it works.

n8n names new credentials "*node name* account" by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app or service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials.

## Expressions in credentials

You can use [expressions](../../glossary/#expression-n8n) to set credentials dynamically as your workflow runs:

1. In your workflow, find the data path containing the credential. This varies depending on the exact parameter names in your data. Make sure that the data containing the credential is available in the workflow when you get to the node that needs it.
1. When creating your credential, hover over the field where you want to use an expression.
1. Toggle **Expression** on.
1. Enter your expression.

[View workflow file](/_workflows/credentials/dynamic_credentials_using_expressions.json)

#### Using the example

To load the template into your n8n instance:

1. Download the workflow JSON file.
1. Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.
1. Copy in the JSON, or select **Workflow menu** > **Import from file...**.

The example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:

- Yellow: notes and information.
- Green: instructions to run the workflow.
- Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.
- Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example.

## Respond to Webhook

**URL:** llms-txt#respond-to-webhook

**Contents:**
- How to use Respond to Webhook
- Node parameters
  - Respond With
- Node options
- How n8n secures HTML responses
- Templates and examples
- Workflow behavior
- Output the response sent to the webhook
- Return more than one data item (deprecated)

Use the Respond to Webhook node to control the response to incoming webhooks. This node works with the [Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node.

Runs once for the first data item

The Respond to Webhook node runs once, using the first incoming data item. Refer to [Return more than one data item](#return-more-than-one-data-item-deprecated) for more information.

## How to use Respond to Webhook

To use the Respond to Webhook node:

1. Add a [Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node as the trigger node for the workflow.
1. In the Webhook node, set **Respond** to **Using 'Respond to Webhook' node**.
1. Add the Respond to Webhook node anywhere in your workflow. If you want it to return data from other nodes, place it after those nodes.

Configure the node behavior using these parameters.

Choose what data to send in the webhook response.

- **All Incoming Items**: Respond with all the JSON items from the input.
- **Binary File**: Respond with a binary file defined in **Response Data Source**.
- **First Incoming Item**: Respond with the first incoming item's JSON.
- **JSON**: Respond with a JSON object defined in **Response Body**.
- **JWT Token**: Respond with a JSON Web Token (JWT).
- **No Data**: No response payload.
- **Redirect**: Redirect to a URL set in **Redirect URL**.
- **Text**: Respond with text set in **Response Body**. This sends HTML by default (`Content-Type: text/html`).

Select **Add Option** to view and set the options.

- **Response Code**: Set the [response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) to use.
- **Response Headers**: Define the response headers to send.
- **Put Response in Field**: Available when you respond with **All Incoming Items** or **First Incoming Item**. Set the field name for the field containing the response data.
- **Enable Streaming**: When enabled, sends the data back to the user using streaming. Requires a trigger configured with the **Response mode** **Streaming**.

## How n8n secures HTML responses

Starting with [n8n version 1.103.0](../../../../release-notes/#n8n11030), n8n automatically wraps HTML responses to webhooks in `<iframe>` tags. This is a security mechanism to protect the instance users.

This has the following implications:

- HTML renders in a sandboxed iframe instead of directly in the parent document.
- JavaScript code that attempts to access the top-level window or local storage will fail.
- Authentication headers aren't available in the sandboxed iframe (for example, basic auth). You need to use an alternative approach, like embedding a short-lived access token within the HTML.
- Relative URLs (for example, `<form action="/">`) won't work. Use absolute URLs instead.

[Browse Respond to Webhook integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/respond-to-webhook/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)

When using the Respond to Webhook node, workflows behave as follows:

- The workflow finishes without executing the Respond to Webhook node: it returns a standard message with a 200 status.
- The workflow errors before the first Respond to Webhook node executes: the workflow returns an error message with a 500 status.
- A second Respond to Webhook node executes after the first one: the workflow ignores it.
- A Respond to Webhook node executes but there was no webhook: the workflow ignores the Respond to Webhook node.

## Output the response sent to the webhook

By default, the Respond to Webhook node has a single output branch that contains the node's input data.

You can optionally enable a second output branch containing the response sent to the webhook. To enable this secondary output, open the Respond to Webhook node on the canvas and select the **Settings** tab. Activate the **Enable Response Output Branch** option.

The node will now have two outputs:

- **Input Data**: The original output, passing on the node's input.
- **Response**: The response object sent to the webhook.

## Return more than one data item (deprecated)

n8n 1.22.0 added support for returning all data items using the **All Incoming Items** option. n8n recommends upgrading to the latest version of n8n, instead of using the workarounds described in this section.

The Respond to Webhook node runs once, using the first incoming data item. This includes when using [expressions](../../../../code/expressions/). You can't force looping using the Loop node: the workflow will run, but the webhook response will still only contain the results of the first execution.

If you need to return more than one data item, choose one of these options:

- Instead of using the Respond to Webhook node, use the **When Last Node Finishes** option in **Respond** in the Webhook node. Use this when you want to return the final data that the workflow outputs.
- Use the [Aggregate](../n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/) node to turn multiple items into a single item before passing the data to the Respond to Webhook node. Set **Aggregate** to **All Item Data (Into a Single List)**.

## Automating a (Real-world) Use Case

**URL:** llms-txt#automating-a-(real-world)-use-case

**Contents:**
- Understanding the scenario

Meet Nathan 🙋. Nathan works as an Analytics Manager at ABCorp. His job is to support the ABCorp team with reporting and analytics. Being a true jack of all trades, he also handles several miscellaneous initiatives.

Some things that Nathan does are repetitive and mind-numbing. He wants to automate some of these tasks so that he doesn't burn out. As an **Automation Expert**, you are meeting with Nathan today to help him understand how he can offload some of his responsibilities to n8n.

## Understanding the scenario

**You 👩‍🔧:** Nice to meet you, Nathan. Glad to be doing this! What's a repetitive task that's error-prone and that you'd like to get off your plate first?

**Nathan 🙋:** Thanks for coming in! The most annoying one's gotta be the weekly sales reporting.

I have to collect sales data from our legacy data warehouse, which manages data from the main business processes of an organization, such as sales or production. Now, each sales order can have the status Processing or Booked. I have to calculate the sum of all the Booked orders and announce them in the company Discord every Monday. Then I have to create a spreadsheet of all the Processing sales so that the Sales Managers can review them and check if they need to follow up with customers.

This manual work is tough and requires high attention to detail to make sure that all the numbers are right. Inevitably, I lose my focus and mistype a number or I don't get it done on time. I've been criticized once by my manager for miscalculating the data.

**You 👩‍🔧:** Oh no! Doesn't the data warehouse have a way to export the data?

**Nathan 🙋:** The data warehouse was written in-house ages ago. It doesn't have a CSV export but they recently added a couple of API endpoints that expose this data, if that helps.

**You 👩‍🔧:** Perfect! That's a good start. If you have a generic API, we can add some custom code and a couple of services to make an automated workflow. This gig has n8n written all over it. Let's get started!

## Set up source control for environments

**URL:** llms-txt#set-up-source-control-for-environments

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Step 1: Set up your repository and branches
- Step 2: Configure Git in n8n
- Step 3: Set up authentication
  - SSH authentication (using deploy keys)
  - HTTPS authentication (using Personal Access Tokens)
- Step 4: Connect n8n and configure your instance

Link a Git repository to an n8n instance and configure your source control.

n8n uses source control to provide environments. Refer to [Environments in n8n](../understand/environments/) for more information.

To use source control with n8n, you need a Git repository with either:

- SSH access (using deploy keys), or
- HTTPS access (using Personal Access Tokens)

This document assumes you are familiar with Git and your Git provider.

## Step 1: Set up your repository and branches

1. Create a new repository for use with n8n.
1. Create the branches you need. For example, if you plan to have different environments for test and production, set up a branch for each.

To help decide what branches you need for your use case, refer to [Branch patterns](../understand/patterns/).

## Step 2: Configure Git in n8n

1. Go to **Settings** > **Environments**.
1. Choose your connection method:
   - **SSH**: In **Git repository URL**, enter the SSH URL for your repository (for example, `git@github.com:username/repo.git`).
   - **HTTPS**: In **Git repository URL** enter the HTTPS URL for your repository (for example, `https://github.com/username/repo.git`).
1. Configure authentication based on your connection method:
   - **For SSH**: n8n supports ED25519 and RSA public key algorithms. ED25519 is the default. Select **RSA** under **SSH Key** if your git host requires RSA. Copy the SSH key.
   - **For HTTPS**: Enter your credentials:
     - **Username**: Your Git provider username.
     - **Token**: Your Personal Access Token (PAT) from your Git provider.

## Step 3: Set up authentication

Configure authentication based on your chosen connection method.

### SSH authentication (using deploy keys)

Set up SSH access by creating a deploy key for the repository using the SSH key from n8n. The key must have write access.

The steps depend on your Git provider. Help links for common providers:

- [GitHub | Managing deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys)
- [GitLab | Deploy keys](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_keys/)

### HTTPS authentication (using Personal Access Tokens)

Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with repository access permissions.

Help links for creating PATs with common providers:

- [GitHub | Managing personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
- [GitLab | Personal access tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html)
- [Bitbucket | App passwords](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/)

Required permissions for your token:

- Repository read/write access
- Contents read/write (for GitHub)
- Source code pull/push (for GitLab)

## Step 4: Connect n8n and configure your instance

1. In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**. n8n connects to your Git repository.
1. Under **Instance settings**, choose which branch you want to use for the current n8n instance.
1. **Optional**: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance. This is useful for protecting production instances.
1. **Optional**: choose a custom color for the instance. This will appear in the menu next to the source control push and pull buttons. It helps users know which instance they're in.
1. Select **Save settings**.

## Binary data environment variables

**URL:** llms-txt#binary-data-environment-variables

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

By default, n8n uses memory to store binary data. Enterprise users can choose to use an external service instead. Refer to [External storage](../../../scaling/external-storage/) for more information on using external storage for binary data.

## What are vector databases?

**URL:** llms-txt#what-are-vector-databases?

**Contents:**
- A simplified example
- Demonstrating the power of similarity search
- Embeddings, retrievers, text splitters, and document loaders

Vector databases store information as numbers:

> A vector database is a type of database that stores data as high-dimensional vectors, which are mathematical representations of features or attributes. ([source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/memories/vector-db))

This enables fast and accurate similarity searches. With a vector database, instead of using conventional database queries, you can search for relevant data based on semantic and contextual meaning.

## A simplified example

A vector database could store the sentence "n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host", but instead of storing it as text, the vector database stores an array of dimensions (numbers between 0 and 1) that represent its features. This doesn't mean turning each letter in the sentence into a number. Instead, the vectors in the vector database describe the sentence.

Suppose that in a vector store `0.1` represents `automation tool`, `0.2` represents `source available`, and `0.3` represents `can be self-hosted`. You could end up with the following vectors:

| Sentence                                                         | Vector (array of dimensions) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host | [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]              |
| Zapier is an automation tool                                     | [0.1]                        |
| Make is an automation tool                                       | [0.1]                        |
| Confluence is a wiki tool that you can self-host                 | [0.3]                        |

This example is very simplified

In practice, vectors are far more complex. A vector can range in size from tens to thousands of dimensions. The dimensions don't have a one-to-one relationship to a single feature, so you can't translate individual dimensions directly into single concepts. This example gives an approximate mental model, not a true technical understanding.

## Demonstrating the power of similarity search

Qdrant provides [vector search demos](https://qdrant.tech/demo/) to help users understand the power of vector databases. The [food discovery demo](https://food-discovery.qdrant.tech/) shows how a vector store can help match pictures based on visual similarities.

> This demo uses data from Delivery Service. Users may like or dislike the photo of a dish, and the app will recommend more similar meals based on how they look. It's also possible to choose to view results from the restaurants within the delivery radius. ([source](https://qdrant.tech/demo/))

For full technical details, refer to the [Qdrant demo-food-discovery GitHub repository](https://github.com/qdrant/demo-food-discovery).

## Embeddings, retrievers, text splitters, and document loaders

Vector databases require other tools to function:

- Document loaders and text splitters: document loaders pull in documents and data, and prepare them for [embedding](../../../glossary/#ai-embedding). Document loaders can use text splitters to break documents into chunks.
- Embeddings: these are the tools that turn the data (text, images, and so on) into vectors, and back into raw data. Note that n8n only supports text embeddings.
- Retrievers: retrievers fetch documents from vector databases. You need to pair them with an embedding to translate the vectors back into data.

## Compare Datasets

**URL:** llms-txt#compare-datasets

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
- Understand item comparison
- Node options
  - Fields to Skip Comparing
  - Disable Dot Notation
  - Multiple Matches
- Understand the output
- Templates and examples

The Compare Datasets node helps you compare data from two input streams.

1. Decide which fields to compare. In **Input A Field**, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream A. In **Input B Field**, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream B.
1. **Optional**: You can compare by multiple fields. Select **Add Fields to Match** to set up more comparisons.
1. Choose how to handle differences between the datasets. In **When There Are Differences**, select one of the following:
   - **Use Input A Version** to treat input stream A as the source of truth.
   - **Use Input B Version** to treat input stream B as the source of truth.
   - **Use a Mix of Versions** to use different inputs for different fields.
     - Use **Prefer** to select either **Input A Version** or **Input B Version** as the main source of truth.
     - Enter input fields that are exceptions to **For Everything Except** to pull from the other input source. To add multiple input fields, enter a comma-separated list.
   - **Include Both Versions** to include both input streams in the output, which may make the structure more complex.
1. Decide whether to use **Fuzzy Compare**. When turned on, the comparison will tolerate small type differences when comparing fields. For example, the number 3 and the string `3` are treated as the same with **Fuzzy Compare** turned on, but wouldn't be treated the same with it turned off.

## Understand item comparison

Item comparison is a two stage process:

1. n8n checks if the values of the fields you selected to compare match across both inputs.
1. If the fields to compare match, n8n then compares all fields within the items, to determine if the items are the same or different.

Use the node **Options** to refine your comparison or tweak comparison behavior.

### Fields to Skip Comparing

Enter field names that you want to ignore in the comparison.

For example, if you compare the two datasets below using `person.language` as the **Fields to Match**, n8n returns them as different. If you add `person.name` to **Fields to Skip Comparing**, n8n returns them as matching.

### Disable Dot Notation

Whether to disallow referencing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name (turned on) or allow it (turned off, default).

Choose how to handle duplicate data. The default is **Include All Matches**. You can choose **Include First Match Only**.

For example, given these two datasets:

n8n returns three items in the **Same Branch** tab. The data is the same in both branches.

If you select **Include First Match Only**, n8n returns two items, in the **Same Branch** tab. The data is the same in both branches, but n8n only returns the first occurrence of the matching "apple" items.

## Understand the output

There are four output options:

- **In A only Branch**: Contains data that occurs only in the first input.
- **Same Branch**: Contains data that's the same in both inputs.
- **Different Branch**: Contains data that's different between inputs.
- **In B only Branch**: Contains data that occurs only in the second output.

- Templates and examples
- Related resources

The Reranker Cohere node allows you to [rerank](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking) the resulting chunks from a [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store). You can connect this node to a vector store.

The reranker reorders the list of documents retrieved from a vector store for a given query in order of descending relevance.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Reranker Cohere node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/cohere/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

Choose the reranking model to use. You can find out more about the available models in [Cohere's model documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models#rerank).

## Microsoft SQL credentials

**URL:** llms-txt#microsoft-sql-credentials

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Supported authentication methods
- Related resources
- Using SQL database connection

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Microsoft SQL](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftsql/)

Create a user account on a [Microsoft SQL server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/what-is-sql-server) database.

## Supported authentication methods

- SQL database connection

Refer to [Microsoft's Connect to SQL Server documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/connect-to-database-engine?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=sqldb#connect-to-sql-server) for more information about connecting to the service.

## Using SQL database connection

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The **Server** name
- The **Database** name
- Your **User** account/ID
- Your **Password**
- The **Port** to use for the connection
- The **Domain** name
- Whether to use **TLS**
- Whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**
- The **Connect Timeout**
- The **Request Timeout**
- The **TDS Version** the connection should use

To set up the database connection:

1. Enter the SQL Server Host Name as the **Server**. In an existing SQL Server connection, the host name comes before the instance name in the format `HOSTNAME\INSTANCENAME`. Find the host name:

- In the **Object Explorer** pane as the top-level object for your database.
   - In the footer of a query window.
   - Viewing the current connection **Properties** and looking for **Name** or **Display Name**.
   - Refer to [Find SQL Server Instance Name | When you're connected to SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#when-youre-connected-to-sql-server) for more information. You can also find the information in the [Error logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#before-you-connect-to-sql-server).

1. Enter the SQL Server Instance Name as the **Database** name. Find this name using the same steps listed above for finding the host name.

- If you don't see an instance name in any of these places, then your database uses the default `MSSQLSERVER` instance name.

1. Enter your **User** account name or ID.

1. Enter your **Password**.

- SQL Server defaults to `1433`.
   - If you can't connect over port 1433, check the [Error logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#before-you-connect-to-sql-server) for the phrase `Server is listening on` to identify the port number you should enter.

1. You only need to enter the **Domain** name if users in multiple domains access your database. Run this SQL query to get the domain name:

1. Select whether to use **TLS**.

1. Select whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**: If turned on, the credential will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.

1. Enter the number of milliseconds n8n should attempt the initial connection to complete before disconnecting as the **Connect Timeout**. Refer to the [SqlConnection.ConnectionTimeout property documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.connectiontimeout) for more information.

- SQL Server stores this timeout as seconds, while n8n stores it as milliseconds. If you're copying your SQL Server defaults, multiple by 100 before entering the number here.

1. Enter the number of milliseconds n8n should wait on a given request before timing out as the **Request Timeout**. This is basically a query timeout parameter. Refer to [Troubleshoot query time-out errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/performance/troubleshoot-query-timeouts#explanation) for more information.

1. Select the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol to use from the **TDS Version** dropdown. If the server doesn't support the version you select here, the connection uses a negotiated alternate version. Refer to [Appendix A: Product Behavior](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tds/135d0ebe-5c4c-4a94-99bf-1811eccb9f4a) for a more detailed breakdown of the TDS versions' compatibility with different SQL Server versions and .NET frameworks. Options include:

- **7_4 (SQL Server 2012 ~ 2019)**: TDS version 7.4.
   - **7_3_B (SQL Server 2008R2)**: TDS version 7.3.B.
   - **7_3_A (SQL Server 2008)**: TDS version 7.3.A.
   - **7_2 (SQL Server 2005)**: TDS version 7.2.
   - **7_1 (SQL Server 2000)**: TDS version 7.1.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
SELECT DEFAULT_DOMAIN()[DomainName];

- Create a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) account.
- Create a LinkedIn [Company Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a543852).

## Supported authentication methods

- **Community Management OAuth2**: Use this method if you're a new LinkedIn user or creating a new LinkedIn app.
- **OAuth2**: Use this method for older LinkedIn apps and user accounts.

Refer to [LinkedIn's Community Management API documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/community-management/community-management-overview?view=li-lms-2024-04) for more information about the service.

This credential works with API version `202404`.

## Using Community Management OAuth2

Use this method if you're a new LinkedIn user or creating a new LinkedIn app.

To configure this credential, you'll need a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) account, a LinkedIn [Company Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a543852), and:

- A **Client ID**: Generated after you create a new developer app.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated after you create a new developer app.

To create a new developer app and set up the credential:

1. Log into LinkedIn and select this link to [create a new developer app](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps/new).
1. Enter an **App name** for your app, like `n8n integration`.
1. For the **LinkedIn Page**, enter a LinkedIn [Company Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a543852) or use the **Create a new LinkedIn Page** link to create one on-the-fly. Refer to [Associate an App with a LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a548360) for more information.
1. Add an **App logo**.
1. Check the box to agree to the **Legal agreement**.
1. Select **Create app**.
1. This should open the **Products** tab. Select the products/APIs you want to enable for your app. For the LinkedIn node to work properly, you must include and configure:
   - **Share on LinkedIn**
   - **Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect**
   - **Advertising API** (if using it as an organization account rather than an individual)
1. Once you've requested access to the products you need, open the **Auth** tab.
1. Copy the **Client ID** and enter it in your n8n credential.
1. Select the icon to **Copy** the **Primary Client Secret**. Enter this in your n8n credential as the **Client Secret**.

Posting from organization accounts

To post as an organization, you need to put your app through LinkedIn's [Community Management App Review](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/community-management-app-review) process.

Refer to [Getting Access to LinkedIn APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/getting-access) for more information on scopes and permissions.

Only use this method for older LinkedIn apps and user accounts.

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

All users must select:

- **Organization Support**: If turned on, the credential requests permission to post as an organization using the `w_organization_social` scope.
  - To use this option, you must put your app through LinkedIn's [Community Management App Review](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/community-management-app-review) process.
- **Legacy**: If turned on, the credential uses legacy scopes for `r_liteprofile` and `r_emailaddress` instead of the newer `profile` and `email` scopes.

If you're [self-hosting](../../../../hosting/) n8n, you'll need to configure OAuth2 from scratch by creating a new developer app:

## Endpoints environment variables

**URL:** llms-txt#endpoints-environment-variables

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

## What's an agent in AI?

**URL:** llms-txt#what's-an-agent-in-ai?

**Contents:**
- Agents in n8n

One way to think of an [agent](../../../glossary/#ai-agent) is as a [chain](../understand-chains/) that knows how to make decisions. Where a chain follows a predetermined sequence of calls to different AI components, an agent uses a language model to determine which actions to take.

Agents are the part of AI that act as decision-makers. They can interact with other agents and [tools](../../../glossary/#ai-tool). When you send a query to an agent, it tries to choose the best tools to use to answer. Agents adapt to your specific queries, as well as the prompts that configure their behavior.

n8n provides one Agent node, which can act as different types of agent depending on the settings you choose. Refer to the [Agent node documentation](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) for details on the available agent types.

When you execute a workflow containing an agent, the agent runs multiple times. For example, it may do an initial setup, followed by a run to call a tool, then another run to evaluate the tool response and respond to the user.

  - Light evaluation (pre-deployment)

## What are evaluations?

Evaluation is a crucial technique for checking that your AI workflow is reliable. It can be the difference between a flaky proof of concept and a solid production workflow. It's important both in the building phase and after deploying to production.

The foundation of evaluation is running a test dataset through your workflow. This dataset contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains a sample input for your workflow, and often includes the expected output(s) too.

Evaluation allows you to:

- **Test your workflow over a range of inputs** so you know how it performs on edge cases
- **Make changes with confidence** without inadvertently making things worse elsewhere
- **Compare performance** across different models or prompts

The following video explains what evaluations are, why they're useful, and how they work:

## Why is evaluation needed?

AI models are fundamentally different than code. Code is deterministic and you can reason about it. This is difficult to do with LLMs, since they're black boxes. Instead, you must *measure* LLM output by running data through them and observing the output.

You can only build confidence that your model performs reliably after you have run it over multiple inputs that accurately reflect all the edge cases that it will have to deal with in production.

## Two types of evaluation

### Light evaluation (pre-deployment)

Building a clean, comprehensive dataset is hard. In the initial building phase, it often makes sense to generate just a handful of examples. These can be enough to iterate the workflow to a releasable state (or a proof of concept). You can visually compare the results to get a sense of the workflow's quality, without setting up formal metrics.

### Metric-based evaluation (post-deployment)

Once you deploy your workflow, it's easier to build a bigger, more representative dataset from production executions. When you discover a bug, you can add the input that caused it to the dataset. When fixing the bug, it's important to run the whole dataset over the workflow again as a [regression test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing) to check that the fix hasn't inadvertently made something else worse.

Since there are too many test cases to check individually, evaluations measure the quality of the outputs using a metric, a numeric value representing a particular characteristic. This also allows you to track quality changes between runs.

### Comparison of evaluation types

|                                                  | Light evaluation (pre-deployment) | Metric-based evaluation (post-deployment) |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Performance improvements with each iteration** | Large                             | Small                                     |
| **Dataset size**                                 | Small                             | Large                                     |
| **Dataset sources**                              | Hand-generated AI-generated Other | Production executions AI-generated Other  |
| **Actual outputs**                               | Required                          | Required                                  |
| **Expected outputs**                             | Optional                          | Required (usually)                        |
| **Evaluation** **metric**                        | Optional                          | Required                                  |

## Best practices for user management

**URL:** llms-txt#best-practices-for-user-management

**Contents:**
- All platforms
- Self-hosted

This page contains advice on best practices relating to user management in n8n.

- n8n recommends that owners create a member-level account for themselves. Owners can see all workflows, but there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.
- Users must be careful not to edit the same workflow simultaneously. It's possible to do it, but the users will overwrite each other's changes.
- To move workflows between accounts, export the workflow as JSON, then import it to the new account. Note that this action loses the workflow history.
- Webhook paths must be unique across the entire instance. This means each webhook path must be unique for all workflows and all users. By default, n8n generates a long random value for the webhook path, but users can edit this to their own custom path. If two users set the same path value:
  - The path works for the first workflow that's run or activated.
  - Other workflows will error if they try to run with the same path.

If you run n8n behind a reverse proxy, set the following environment variables so that n8n generates emails with the correct URL:

- `N8N_HOST`
- `N8N_PORT`
- `N8N_PROTOCOL`
- `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`

More information on these variables is available in [Environment variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).
