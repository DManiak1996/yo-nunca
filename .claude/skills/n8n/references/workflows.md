## HTTP Request node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#http-request-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Bad request - please check your parameters
- The resource you are requesting could not be found
- JSON parameter need to be an valid JSON
- Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials
- 429 - The service is receiving too many requests from you
  - Batching
  - Retry on Fail

Here are some common errors and issues with the [HTTP Request node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Bad request - please check your parameters

This error displays when the node receives a 400 error indicating a bad request. This error most often occurs because:

- You're using an invalid name or value in a **Query Parameter**.
- You're passing array values in a **Query Parameter** but the array isn't formatted correctly. Try using the [**Array Format in Query Parameters**](../#array-format-in-query-parameters) option.

Review the API documentation for your service to format your query parameters.

## The resource you are requesting could not be found

This error displays when the endpoint **URL** you entered is invalid.

This may be due to a typo in the URL or a deprecated API. Refer to your service's API documentation to verify you have a valid endpoint.

## JSON parameter need to be an valid JSON

This error displays when you've passed a parameter as JSON and it's not formatted as valid JSON.

To resolve, review the JSON you've entered for these issues:

- Test your JSON in a JSON checker or syntax parser to find errors like missing quotation marks, extra or missing commas, incorrectly formatted arrays, extra or missing square brackets or curly brackets, and so on.

- If you've used an **Expression** in the node, be sure you've wrapped the entire JSON in double curly brackets, for example:

## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials

This error displays when the node receives a 403 error indicating authentication failed.

To resolve, review the selected credentials and make sure you can authenticate with them. You may need to:

- Update permissions or scopes so that your API key or account can perform the operation you've selected.
- Format your generic credential in a different way.
- Generate a new API key or token with the appropriate permissions or scopes.

## 429 - The service is receiving too many requests from you

This error displays when the node receives a [429 error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) from the service that you're calling. This often means that you have hit the rate limits of that service. You can find out more on the [Handling API rate limits](../../../rate-limits/) page.

To resolve the error, you can use one of the built-in options of the HTTP request node:

Use this option to send requests in batches and introduce a delay between them.

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option > Batching**.
1. Set **Items per Batch** to the number of input items to include in each request.
1. Set **Batch Interval (ms)** to introduce a delay between requests in milliseconds. For example, to send one request to an API per second, set **Batch Interval (ms)** to `1000`.

Use this option to retry the node after a failed attempt.

1. In the HTTP Request node, go to **Settings** and enable **Retry on Fail**.
1. Set **Max Tries** to the maximum number of times n8n should retry the node.
1. Set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to the desired delay in milliseconds between retries. For example, to wait one second before retrying the request again, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000`.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
{{
      {
      "myjson":
      {
          "name1": "value1",
          "name2": "value2",
          "array1":
              ["value1","value2"]
      }
      }
  }}
```

## Vercel AI Gateway Chat Model node

**URL:** llms-txt#vercel-ai-gateway-chat-model-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Model
- Node options
  - Frequency Penalty
  - Maximum Number of Tokens
  - Response Format
  - Presence Penalty
  - Sampling Temperature
  - Timeout
  - Max Retries

Use the Vercel AI Gateway Chat Model node to use AI Gateway chat models with conversational agents.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Vercel AI Gateway Chat Model node and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/vercel/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

Select the model to use to generate the completion.

n8n dynamically loads models from the AI Gateway and you'll only see the models available to your account.

Use these options to further refine the node's behavior.

### Frequency Penalty

Use this option to control the chance of the model repeating itself. Higher values reduce the chance of the model repeating itself.

### Maximum Number of Tokens

Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.

Choose **Text** or **JSON**. **JSON** ensures the model returns valid JSON.

Use this option to control the chance of the model talking about new topics. Higher values increase the chance of the model talking about new topics.

### Sampling Temperature

Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.

Enter the maximum request time in milliseconds.

Enter the maximum number of times to retry a request.

Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

## Scaling n8n

**URL:** llms-txt#scaling-n8n

When running n8n at scale, with a large number of users, workflows, or executions, you need to change your n8n configuration to ensure good performance.

n8n can run in different [modes](../queue-mode/) depending on your needs. The `queue` mode provides the best scalability. Refer to [Queue mode](../queue-mode/) for configuration details.

You can configure data saving and pruning to improve database performance. Refer to [Execution data](../execution-data/) for details.

## Code node

**URL:** llms-txt#code-node

**Contents:**
- Usage
  - Choose a mode
- JavaScript
  - Supported JavaScript features
  - External libraries
  - Built-in methods and variables
  - Keyboard shortcuts
- Python (Pyodide - legacy)
  - Built-in methods and variables
  - Keyboard shortcuts

Use the Code node to write custom JavaScript or Python and run it as a step in your workflow.

This page gives usage information about the Code node. For more guidance on coding in n8n, refer to the [Code](../../../../code/) section. It includes:

- Reference documentation on [Built-in methods and variables](../../../../code/builtin/overview/)
- Guidance on [Handling dates](../../../../code/cookbook/luxon/) and [Querying JSON](../../../../code/cookbook/jmespath/)
- A growing collection of examples in the [Cookbook](../../../../code/cookbook/code-node/)

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Code integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/code/) page.

Function and Function Item nodes

The Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the [Function node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function.md) and [Function Item node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.functionItem.md).

How to use the Code node.

- **Run Once for All Items**: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.
- **Run Once for Each Item**: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.

The Code node supports Node.js.

### Supported JavaScript features

The Code node supports:

- Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.
- Writing to your browser console using `console.log`. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.

### External libraries

If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the [Enable modules in Code node](../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) guide.

If you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:

- [crypto Node.js module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/crypto.html)
- [moment npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)

### Built-in methods and variables

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../../../../code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `$variableName` or `$methodName()`. Type `$` in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. See the full list of [keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts/).

## Python (Pyodide - legacy)

Pyodide is a legacy feature. Future versions of n8n will no longer support this feature.

n8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the [Packages included with Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide). n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.

Slower than JavaScript

The Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.

### Built-in methods and variables

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../../../../code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `_variableName` or `_methodName()`. Type `_` in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. See the full list of [keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts/).

## File system and HTTP requests

You can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:

- [Read/Write File From Disk](../n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)
- [HTTP Request](../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)

## Python (Native - beta)

n8n added native Python support using task runners (beta) in version 1.111.0.

Main differences from Pyodide:

- Native Python supports only `_items` in all-items mode and `_item` in per-item mode. It doesn't support other n8n built-in methods and variables.
- Native Python supports importing native Python modules from the standard library and from third-parties, if the `n8nio/runners` image includes them and explicitly allowlists them. See [adding extra dependencies for task runners](../../../../hosting/configuration/task-runners/#adding-extra-dependencies) for more details.
- Native Python denies insecure built-ins by default. See [task runners environment variables](../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/) for more details.
- Unlike Pyodide, which accepts dot access notation, for example, `item.json.myNewField`, native Python only accepts bracket access notation, for example, `item["json"]["my_new_field"]`. There may be other minor syntax differences where Pyodide accepts constructs that aren't legal in native Python.

Keep in mind upgrading to native Python is a breaking change, so you may need to adjust your Python scripts to use the native Python runner.

This feature is in beta and is subject to change. As it becomes stable, n8n will roll it out progressively to n8n cloud users during 2025. Self-hosting users can [try it out](../../../../hosting/configuration/task-runners/) and provide feedback.

There are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.

When working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:

- [Data structure](../../../../data/data-structure/): understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.
- [Item linking](../../../../data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/): learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.

### Built-in methods and variables

n8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:

- Accessing specific item data
- Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment
- Convenience variables to help with data and time

Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../../../../code/builtin/overview/) for more information.

## Use AI in the Code node

AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.

AI generated code overwrites your code

If you've already written some code on the **Code** tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.

To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:

1. In the Code node, set **Language** to **JavaScript**.
1. Select the **Ask AI** tab.
1. Write your query.
1. Select **Generate Code**. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the **Code** tab.

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common Issues](common-issues/).

## Guardrails node

**URL:** llms-txt#guardrails-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Operation
  - Text To Check
  - Guardrails
  - Customize System Message

Use the Guardrails node to enforce safety, security, and content policies on text. You can use it to validate user input *before* sending it to an AI model, or to check the *output* from an AI model before using it in your workflow.

Chat Model Connection Required for LLM-based Guardrails

This node requires a Chat Model node to be connected to its Model input when using the **Check Text for Violations** operation with LLM-based guardrails. Many guardrail checks (like Jailbreak, NSFW, and Topical Alignment) are LLM-based and use this connection to evaluate the input text.

Use these parameters to configure the Guardrails node.

The operation mode for this node to define its behavior.

- **Check Text for Violations**: Provides a full set of guardrails. Any violation will send items to **Fail** branch.
- **Sanitize Text**: Provides a subset of guardrails that can detect URLs, regular expressions, secret keys, or personally identifiable information (PII), such as phone numbers and credit card numbers. The node replaces detected violations with placeholders.

The text the guardrails evaluate. Typically, you map this text using an expression from a previous node, such as text from a user query or a response from an AI model.

Select one or more guardrails to apply to the **Text To Check**. When you add a guardrail from the list, its specific configuration options appear below.

- **Keywords:** Checks if specified keywords appear in the input text.
  - **Keywords**: A comma-separated list of words to block.
- **Jailbreak:** Detects attempts to bypass AI safety measures or exploit the model.
  - **Customize Prompt**: (Boolean) If you turn this on, a text input appears with the default prompt for the jailbreak detection model. You can change this prompt to fine-tune the guardrail.
  - **Threshold**: A value between 0.0 and 1.0. This represents the confidence level required from the AI model to flag the input as a jailbreak attempt. A higher threshold is stricter.
- **NSFW:** Detects attempts to generate Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content.
  - **Customize Prompt**: (Boolean) If you turn this on, a text input appears with the default prompt for the NSFW detection model. You can change this prompt to fine-tune the guardrail.
  - **Threshold**: A value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the confidence level required to flag the content as NSFW.
- **PII:** Detects personally identifiable information (PII) in the text.
  - **Type**: Choose which PII entities to scan for:
    - **All**: Scans for all available entity types.
    - **Selected**: Allows you to choose specific entities from a list.
  - **Entities**: (Appears if **Type** is **Selected**) A multi-select list of PII types to detect (for example, `CREDIT_CARD`, `EMAIL_ADDRESS`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, and `US_SSN`).
- **Secret Keys:** Detects the presence of secret keys or API credentials in the text.
  - **Permissiveness**: How strict or permissive the detection should be when flagging secret keys:
    - **Strict**
    - **Permissive**
    - **Balanced**
- **Topical Alignment:** Ensures the conversation stays within a predefined scope or topic (also known as "business scope").
  - **Prompt**: A preset prompt that defines the *allowed* topic. The guardrail checks if the **Text To Check** aligns with this prompt.
  - **Threshold**: A value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the confidence level required to flag the input as *off-topic*.
- **URLs:** Manages URLs the node finds in the input text. It detects all URLs as violations, unless you specify them in **Block All URLs Except**.
  - **Block All URLs Except**: (Optional) A comma-separated list of URLs that you permit.
  - **Allowed Schemes**: Select the URL schemes to permit (for example, `https`, `http`, `ftp`, and `mailto`).
  - **Block userinfo**: (Boolean) If you turn this on, the node blocks URLs containing user credentials (for example, `user:pass@example.com`) to prevent credential injection.
  - **Allow subdomain**: (Boolean) If you turn this on, the node automatically allows subdomains of any URL in the **Block All URLs Except** list (for example, `sub.example.com` would be allowed if `example.com` is in the list).
- **Custom:** Define your own custom, LLM-based guardrail.
  - **Name**: A descriptive name for your custom guardrail (for example, "Check for rude language").
  - **Prompt**: A prompt that instructs the AI model what to check for.
  - **Threshold**: A value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the confidence level required to flag the input as a violation.
- **Custom Regex**: Define your own custom regular expression patterns.
  - **Name**: A name for your custom pattern. The node uses this name as a placeholder in the **Sanitize Text** mode.
  - **Regex**: Your regular expression pattern.

### Customize System Message

If you turn this on, a text input appears with a message that the guardrail uses to enforce thresholds and JSON output according to schema. Change it to modify the global guardrails behavior.

## Simple Vector Store node

**URL:** llms-txt#simple-vector-store-node

**Contents:**
- Data safety limitations
  - Vector store data isn't persistent
  - All instance users can access vector store data
- Node usage patterns
  - Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents
  - Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool
  - Use a retriever to fetch documents
  - Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions
- Memory Management
  - Configuration Options

Use the Simple Vector Store node to store and retrieve [embeddings](../../../../../glossary/#ai-embedding) in n8n's in-app memory.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Simple Vector Store node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

This node is different from AI memory nodes

The simple vector storage described here is different to the AI memory nodes such as [Simple Memory](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/).

This node creates a [vector database](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store) in the app memory.

## Data safety limitations

Before using the Simple Vector Store node, it's important to understand its limitations and how it works.

n8n recommends using Simple Vector store for development use only.

### Vector store data isn't persistent

This node stores data in memory only. All data is lost when n8n restarts and may also be purged in low-memory conditions.

### All instance users can access vector store data

Memory keys for the Simple Vector Store node are global, not scoped to individual workflows.

This means that all users of the instance can access vector store data by adding a Simple Vector Store node and selecting the memory key, regardless of the access controls set for the original workflow. Take care not to expose sensitive information when ingesting data with the Simple Vector Store node.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the Simple Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents

You can use the Simple Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Simple Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of in step 2 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the Simple Vector Store node directly to the [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Simple Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Simple Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Simple Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Simple Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Simple Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Simple Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Simple Vector store.

The Simple Vector Store implements memory management to prevent excessive memory usage:

- Automatically cleans up old vector stores when memory pressure increases
- Removes inactive stores that haven't been accessed for a configurable amount of time

### Configuration Options

You can control memory usage with these environment variables:

| Variable                      | Type   | Default | Description                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `N8N_VECTOR_STORE_MAX_MEMORY` | Number | -1      | Maximum memory in MB allowed for all vector stores combined (-1 to disable limits). |
| `N8N_VECTOR_STORE_TTL_HOURS`  | Number | -1      | Hours of inactivity after which a store gets removed (-1 to disable TTL).           |

On n8n Cloud, these values are preset to 100MB (about 8,000 documents, depending on document size and metadata) and 7 days respectively. For self-hosted instances, both values default to -1(no memory limits or time-based cleanup).

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt is embedded and used for similarity search. The node returns the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents

Use insert documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Tool for AI Agent)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters

- **Memory Key**: Select or create the key containing the vector memory you want to query.
- **Prompt**: Enter the search query.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Insert Documents parameters

- **Memory Key**: Select or create the key you want to store the vector memory as.
- **Clear Store**: Use this parameter to control whether to wipe the vector store for the given memory key for this workflow before inserting data (turned on).

### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters

- **Memory Key**: Select or create the key containing the vector memory you want to query.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters

- **Name**: The name of the vector store.
- **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
- **Memory Key**: Select or create the key containing the vector memory you want to query.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

## Choose your node building approach

**URL:** llms-txt#choose-your-node-building-approach

**Contents:**
- Data handling differences
- Syntax differences

n8n has two node-building styles, declarative and programmatic.

You should use the declarative style for most nodes. This style:

- Uses a JSON-based syntax, making it simpler to write, with less risk of introducing bugs.
- Is more future-proof.
- Supports integration with REST APIs.

The programmatic style is more verbose. You must use the programmatic style for:

- Trigger nodes
- Any node that isn't REST-based. This includes nodes that need to call a GraphQL API and nodes that use external dependencies.
- Any node that needs to transform incoming data.
- Full versioning. Refer to [Node versioning](../../build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information on types of versioning.

## Data handling differences

The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the `routing` key in the `operations` object. Refer to [Node base file](../../build/reference/node-base-files/) for more information on node parameters and the `execute()` method.

## Syntax differences

To understand the difference between the declarative and programmatic styles, compare the two code snippets below. This example creates a simplified version of the SendGrid integration, called "FriendGrid." The following code snippets aren't complete: they emphasize the differences in the node building styles.

In programmatic style:

In declarative style:

**Examples:**

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

When managing an embedded n8n deployment, spanning across teams or organizations, you will likely need to run the same (or similar) workflows for multiple users. There are two available options for doing so:

| Solution                                                              | Pros                                                               | Cons                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Create a workflow for each user                                       | No limitation on how workflow starts (can use any trigger)         | Requires managing multiple workflows.          |
| Create a single workflow, and pass it user credentials when executing | Simplified workflow management (only need to change one workflow). | To run the workflow, your product must call it |

The APIs referenced in this document are subject to change at any time. Be sure the check for continued functionality with each version upgrade.

There are three general steps to follow:

- Obtain the credentials for each user, and any additional parameters that may be required based on the workflow.
- Create the [n8n credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n) for this user.
- Create the workflow.

### 1. Obtain user credentials

Here you need to capture all credentials for any node/service this user must authenticate with, along with any additional parameters required for the particular workflow. The credentials and any parameters needed will depend on your workflow and what you are trying to do.

### 2. Create user credentials

After all relevant credential details have been obtained, you can proceed to create the relevant service credentials in n8n. This can be done using the Editor UI or API call.

#### Using the Editor UI

1. From the menu select **Credentials** > **New**.
1. Use the drop-down to select the **Credential type** to create, for example *Airtable*.
1. In the **Create New Credentials** modal, enter the corresponding credentials details for the user, and select the nodes that will have access to these credentials.
1. Click **Create** to finish and save.

The frontend API used by the Editor UI can also be called to achieve the same result. The API endpoint is in the format: `https://<n8n-domain>/rest/credentials`.

For example, to create the credentials in the Editor UI example above, the request would be:

With the request body:

The response will contain the ID of the new credentials, which you will use when creating the workflow for this user:

### 3. Create the workflow

Best practice is to have a “base” workflow that you then duplicate and customize for each new user with their credentials (and any other details).

You can duplicate and customize your template workflow using either the Editor UI or API call.

#### Using the Editor UI

1. From the menu select **Workflows** > **Open** to open the template workflow to be duplicated.
1. Select **Workflows** > **Duplicate**, then enter a name for this new workflow and click **Save**.
1. Update all relevant nodes to use the credentials for this user (created above).
1. **Save** this workflow set it to **Active** using the toggle in the top-right corner.

1. Fetch the JSON of the template workflow using the endpoint: `https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows/<workflow_id>`

The response will contain the JSON data of the selected workflow:

1. Save the returned JSON data and update any relevant credentials and fields for the new user.

1. Create a new workflow using the updated JSON as the request body at endpoint: `https://<n8n-domain>/rest/workflows`

The response will contain the ID of the new workflow, which you will use in the next step.

1. Lastly, activate the new workflow:

Passing the additional value `active` in your JSON payload:

There are four steps to follow to implement this method:

- Obtain the credentials for each user, and any additional parameters that may be required based on the workflow. See [Obtain user credentials](#1-obtain-user-credentials) above.
- Create the n8n credentials for this user. See [Create user credentials](#2-create-user-credentials) above.
- Create the workflow.
- Call the workflow as needed.

### Create the workflow

The details and scope of this workflow will vary greatly according to the individual use case, however there are a few design implementations to keep in mind:

- This workflow must be triggered by a [Webhook](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node.
- The incoming webhook call must contain the user’s credentials and any other workflow parameters required.
- Each node where the user’s credentials are needed should use an [expression](../../code/expressions/) so that the node’s credential field reads the credential provided in the webhook call.
- Save and activate the workflow, ensuring the production URL is selected for the Webhook node. Refer to [webhook node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) for more information.

### Call the workflow

For each new user, or for any existing user as may be needed, call the webhook defined as the workflow trigger and provide the necessary credentials (and any other workflow parameters).

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
POST https://<n8n-domain>/rest/credentials
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
{
   "name":"MyAirtable",

      }
   ],
   "data":{
      "apiKey":"q12we34r5t67yu"
   }
}
```

      },
      "nodesAccess":[
         {
            "nodeType":"n8n-nodes-base.airtable",
            "date":"2021-09-10T07:41:27.770Z"
         }
      ],
      "id":"29",
      "createdAt":"2021-09-10T07:41:27.777Z",
      "updatedAt":"2021-09-10T07:41:27.777Z"

## n8n Form node

**URL:** llms-txt#n8n-form-node

**Contents:**
- Setting up the node
  - Set default selections with query parameters
  - Displaying custom HTML
  - Including hidden fields
  - Defining the form using JSON
  - Form Ending
  - Forms with branches
  - Node options
- Running the node
  - Build and test workflows

Use the n8n Form node to create user-facing forms with multiple steps. You can add other nodes with custom logic between to process user input. You must start the workflow with the [n8n Form Trigger node](../n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/).

[View workflow file](/_workflows/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/mutually-exclusive-branching.json)

## Setting up the node

### Set default selections with query parameters

You can set the initial values for fields by using [query parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Web_forms) with the initial URL provided by the [n8n Form Trigger node](../n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/). Every page in the form receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger node URL.

Query parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode.

When using query parameters, [percent-encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like [URL Encode/Decode](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/) to format your query parameters using percent-encoding.

As an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties:

- Production URL: `https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form`
- Fields:
  - `name`: `Jane Doe`
  - `email`: `jane.doe@example.com`

With query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above:

Here, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (`@`) with the string `%40` and the space character () with the string `%20`. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on.

### Displaying custom HTML

You can display custom HTML on your form by adding a **Custom HTML** field to your form. This provides an **HTML** box where you can insert arbitrary HTML code to display as part of the form page.

You can use the HTML field to enrich your form page by including things like links, images, videos, and more. n8n will render the content with the rest of the form fields in the normal document flow.

Because custom HTML content is read-only, these fields aren't included in the form output data by default. To include the raw HTML content in the node output, provide a name for the data using the **Element Name** field.

The HTML field doesn't support `<script>`, `<style>`, or `<input>` elements.

If you're using the [Form Ending](#form-ending) Page Type, you can fully customize the final page that you send users (including the use of `<script>`, `<style>`, and `<input>` elements) by selecting the **On n8n Form Submission** parameter to **Show Text**.

### Including hidden fields

It's possible to include fields in a form without displaying them to users. This is useful when you want to pass extra data to the form that doesn't require interactive user input.

To add fields that won't show up on the form, use the **Hidden Field** form element. There, you can define the **Field Name** and optionally provide a default value by filling out the **Field Value**.

When serving the form, you can pass values for hidden fields using [query parameters](#set-default-selections-with-query-parameters).

### Defining the form using JSON

Use **Define Form** > **Using JSON** to define the fields of your form with a [JSON array of objects](../../../../data/data-structure/). Each object defines a single field by using a combination of these keys:

- `fieldLabel`: The label that appears above the input field.
- `fieldType`: Choose from `checkbox`, `date`, `dropdown`, `email`, `file`, `hiddenField`, `html`, `number`, `password`, `radio`, `text`, or `textarea`.
  - Use `date` to include a date picker in the form. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](../../../../code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information on formatting dates.
  - When using `dropdown`, set the choices with `fieldOptions` (reference the example below). By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, set `multiselect` to `true`. As an alternative, you can use `checkbox` or `radio` together with `fieldOptions` too.
  - When using `file`, set `multipleFiles` to `true` to allow users to select more than one file. To define the file types to allow, set `acceptFileTypes` to a string containing a comma-separated list of file extensions (reference the example below).
  - Use `hiddenField` to add a hidden field to your form. Refer to [Including hidden fields](#including-hidden-fields) for more information.
  - Use `html` to display custom HTML on your form. Refer to [Displaying custom HTML](#displaying-custom-html) for more information.
- `placeholder`: Specify placeholder data for the field. You can use this for every `fieldType` except `dropdown`, `date`, and `file`.
- `requiredField`: Require users to complete this field on the form.

An example JSON that shows the general format required and the keys available:

Use the **Form Ending** Page Type to end a form and either show a completion page, redirect the user to a URL, or display custom HTML or text. Only one Form Ending page displays per execution, even when n8n executes [multiple branches](#forms-with-branches) that contain Form Ending nodes.

Choose between these options when using **On n8n Form Submission**:

- **Show Completion Screen**: Shows users a final screen to confirm that they submitted the form.
  - Fill in **Completion Title** to set the `h1` title on the form.
  - n8n displays the **Completion Message** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break.
  - Select **Add option** and fill in **Completion Page Title** to set the page's title in the browser tab.
- **Redirect to URL**: Redirect the user to a specified URL when the form completes.
  - Fill in the **URL** field with the page you want to redirect to when users complete the form.
- **Show Text**: Display a final page defined by arbitrary plain text and HTML.
  - Fill in the **Text** field with the HTML or plain text content you wish to show.
- **Return Binary File**: Return a binary file upon completion.
  - Fill in **Completion Title** to set the `h1` title on the form.
  - n8n displays the **Completion Message** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break.
  - Provide the **Input Data Field Name** containing the binary file to return to the user.

### Forms with branches

The n8n Form node executes and displays its associated form page whenever it receives data from a previous node. When building forms with n8n, to avoid confusion, it's important to understand how forms behave when branching occurs.

#### Workflows with mutually exclusive branches

Form workflows containing mutually exclusive branches work as expected. n8n will execute a single branch according to the submitted data and conditions you outline. As it executes, n8n will display each page in the branch, ending with an n8n Form node with the **Form Ending** page type.

This workflow demonstrates mutually exclusive branching. Each selection can only execute a single branch.

[View workflow file](/_workflows/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/mutually-exclusive-branching.json)

#### Workflows that may execute multiple branches

Form workflows that send data to multiple branches at the same time require more care. When multiple branches receive data during an execution (for example, from a [switch](../n8n-nodes-base.switch/) node), n8n executes each branch that receives data [sequentially](../../../../flow-logic/execution-order/). Upon reaching the end of one branch, the execution will move to the next branch with data.

n8n only executes a single **Form Ending** n8n Form node for each execution. When multiple branches of a form workflow receive data, n8n ignores all Form Ending nodes except for the one associated with the final branch.

This workflow may execute more than one branch during an execution. Here, n8n executes all valid branches sequentially. This impacts which n8n Form nodes n8n executes (in particular, which **Form Ending** node displays):

[View workflow file](/_workflows/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/multiple-branch-execution.json)

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options:

- **Form Title**: The title for your form. n8n displays the **Form Title** as the webpage title and main `h1` title on the form.
- **Form Description**: The description for your form. n8n displays the **Form Description** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. This field supports HTML. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break. The Form Description also populates the [HTML meta description](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name#standard_metadata_names_defined_in_the_html_specification) for the page.
- **Button Label**: The label to use for your form's submit button. n8n displays the **Button Label** as the name of the submit button.
- **Custom Form Styling**: Override the default styling of the public form interface with CSS. The field pre-populates with the default styling so you can change only what you need to.
- **Completion Page Title**: The title for the final completion page of the form.

### Build and test workflows

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL** in the [n8n Form Trigger node](../n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/). Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging.

There are two ways to test:

- Select **Execute Step**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node and any previous nodes, but not the rest of the workflow.
- Select **Execute Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.

### Production workflows

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the n8n Form Trigger's **Production URL** by opening the trigger node and selecting the **Production URL** in the **From URLS** selector. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form.

When working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.

## Workflow settings

**URL:** llms-txt#workflow-settings

**Contents:**
- Access workflow settings
- Available settings
  - Execution order
  - Error Workflow (to notify when this one errors)
  - This workflow can be called by
  - Timezone
  - Save failed production executions
  - Save successful production executions
  - Save manual executions
  - Save execution progress

You can customize workflow behavior for individual workflows using workflow settings.

## Access workflow settings

To open the settings:

1. Open your workflow.
1. Select the **three dots icon** in the upper-right corner.
1. Select **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.

## Available settings

The following settings are available:

Choose the execution order for multi-branch workflows:

**v1 (recommended)** executes each branch in turn, completing one branch before starting another. n8n orders the branches based on their position on the [canvas](../../glossary/#canvas-n8n), from topmost to bottommost. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost branch executes first.

**v0 (legacy)** executes the first node of each branch, then the second node of each branch, and so on.

### Error Workflow (to notify when this one errors)

Select a workflow to trigger if the current workflow fails. See [error workflows](../../flow-logic/error-handling/) for more details.

### This workflow can be called by

Choose which other workflows can call this workflow.

Sets the timezone for this workflow. The timezone setting is important for the Schedule Trigger node.

You can set your n8n instance's timezone to configure the default timezone workflows use:

- [Set a n8n Cloud instance timezone](../../manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/)
- [Configure the timezone for self-hosted instances](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/)

If you don't configure the workflow or instance timezone, n8n defaults to the EDT (New York) timezone.

### Save failed production executions

Whether n8n should save failed executions for active workflows.

### Save successful production executions

Whether n8n should save successful executions for active workflows.

### Save manual executions

Whether n8n should save executions for workflows started by the user in the editor.

### Save execution progress

Whether n8n should save execution data for each node.

If set to **Save**, the workflow resumes from where it stopped in case of an error. This may increase latency.

Whether n8n should cancel the current workflow execution after a certain amount of time elapses.

When enabled, the **Timeout After** option appears. Here, you can set the time (in hours, minutes, and seconds) after which the workflow should timeout. For n8n Cloud users, n8n enforces a maximum available timeout for each plan.

### Estimated time saved

An estimate of the number of minutes each of execution of this workflow saves you.

Setting this lets n8n calculate the amount of time saved for [insights](../../insights/).

## Workflow Retriever node

**URL:** llms-txt#workflow-retriever-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Source
  - Workflow values
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

Use the Workflow Retriever node to retrieve data from an n8n workflow for use in a Retrieval QA Chain or another Retriever node.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Workflow Retriever node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

Tell n8n which workflow to call. You can choose either:

- **Database** and enter a workflow ID.
- **Parameter** and copy in a complete [workflow JSON](../../../../../workflows/export-import/).

Set values to pass to the workflow you're calling.

These values appear in the output data of the trigger node in the workflow you call. You can access these values in expressions in the workflow. For example, if you have:

- **Workflow Values** with a **Name** of `myCustomValue`
- A workflow with an Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node as its trigger

The expression to access the value of `myCustomValue` is `{{ $('Execute Sub-workflow Trigger').item.json.myCustomValue }}`.

  - Who can use the Assistant?
  - How does the Assistant work?
- Change instance ownership
- Change instance username

The n8n AI Assistant helps you build, debug, and optimize your workflows seamlessly. From answering questions about n8n to providing help with coding and [expressions](../../glossary/#expression-n8n), the AI Assistant can streamline your workflow-building process and support you as you navigate n8n's capabilities.

## Current capabilities

The AI Assistant offers a range of tools to support you:

- **Debug helper**: Identify and troubleshoot node execution issues in your workflows to keep them running without issues.
- **Answer n8n questions**: Get instant answers to your n8n-related questions, whether they're about specific features or general functionality.
- **Coding support**: Receive guidance on coding, including SQL and JSON, to optimize your nodes and data processing.
- **Expression assistance**: Learn how to create and refine [expressions](../../code/expressions/) to get the most out of your workflows.
- **Credential setup tips**: Find out how to set up and manage node [credentials](../../integrations/builtin/credentials/) securely and efficiently.

## Tips for getting the most out of the Assistant

1. **Engage in a conversation**: The AI Assistant can collaborate with you step-by-step. If a suggestion isn't what you need, let it know! The more context you provide, the better the recommendations will be.

1. **Ask specific questions**: For the best results, ask focused questions (for example, "How do I set up credentials for Google Sheets?"). The assistant works best with clear queries.

1. **Iterate on suggestions**: Don't hesitate to build on the assistant's responses. Try different approaches and keep refining based on the assistant's feedback to get closer to your ideal solution.

1. **Things to try out**:

- Debug any error you're seeing
   - Ask how to setup credentials
   - "Explain what this workflow does."
   - "I need your help to write code: [Explain your code here]"
   - "How can I build X in n8n?"

### What context does the Assistant have?

The AI Assistant has access to all elements displayed on your n8n screen, excluding actual input and output data values (like customer information). To learn more about what data n8n shares with the Assistant, refer to [AI in n8n](../../privacy-security/privacy/#ai-in-n8n).

### Who can use the Assistant?

Any user on a Cloud plan can use the assistant.

### How does the Assistant work?

The underlying logic of the assistant is build with the advanced AI capabilities of n8n. It uses a combination of different [agents](../../glossary/#ai-agent), specialized in different areas of n8n, RAG to gather knowledge from the docs and the community forum, and custom prompts, [memory](../../glossary/#ai-memory) and context.

## Change instance ownership

You can change the ownership of an instance by navigating to the **Settings** page in the owner's account and editing the **Email** field. After making the changes, scroll down and press **Save**. Note that for the change to be effective, the new email address can't be linked to any other n8n account.

Changing emails will change the owner of the instance, the email you log in with, and the email your invoices and general communication gets sent to.

If the workspace is deactivated, there will be no **Settings** page and no possibility to change the email address or the owner info.

## Change instance username

It's not currently possible to change usernames.

If you want your instance to have a different name you will need to create a new account and transfer your work into it. [The import/export documentation](../../workflows/export-import/) explains how you can transfer your work to a new n8n instance.

## Chat Trigger node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#chat-trigger-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Pass data from a website to an embedded Chat Trigger node
- Chat Trigger node doesn't fetch previous messages

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Chat Trigger node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Pass data from a website to an embedded Chat Trigger node

When [embedding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/chat) the Chat Trigger node in a website, you might want to pass extra information to the Chat Trigger. For example, passing a user ID stored in a site cookie.

To do this, use the `metadata` field in the JSON object you pass to the `createChat` function in your embedded chat window:

The `metadata` field can contain arbitrary data that will appear in the Chat Trigger output alongside other output data. From there, you can query and process the data from downstream nodes as usual using n8n's [data processing features](../../../../../data/).

## Chat Trigger node doesn't fetch previous messages

When you configure a Chat Trigger node, you might experience problems fetching previous messages if you aren't careful about how you configure session loading. This often manifests as a `workflow could not be started!` error.

In Chat Triggers, the **Load Previous Session** option retrieves previous chat messages for a session using the `sessionID`. When you set the **Load Previous Session** option to **From memory**, it's almost always best to [connect the same memory node](../#load-previous-session) to both the Chat Trigger and the Agent in your workflow:

1. In your **Chat Trigger** node, set the **Load Previous Session** option to **From Memory**. This is only visible if you've made the chat publicly available.
1. Attach a **Simple Memory** node to the **Memory** connector.
1. Attach the same **Simple Memory** node to **Memory** connector of your **Agent**.
1. In the **Simple Memory** node, set **Session ID** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node**.

One instance where you may want to attach separate memory nodes to your Chat Trigger and the Agent is if you want to set the **Session ID** in your memory node to **Define below**.

If you're retrieving the session ID from an expression, the same expression must work for each of the nodes attached to it. If the expression isn't compatible with each of the nodes that need memory, you might need to use separate memory nodes so you can customize the expression for the session ID on a per-node basis.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
createChat({
	webhookUrl: 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL',
	metadata: {
		'YOUR_KEY': 'YOUR_DATA'
	};
});
```

  - Only one 'Manual Trigger' node is allowed in a workflow

Use this node if you want to start a workflow by selecting **Execute Workflow** and don't want any option for the workflow to run automatically.

Workflows always need a trigger, or start point. Most workflows start with a trigger node firing in response to an external event or the [Schedule Trigger](../n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/) firing on a set schedule.

The Manual Trigger node serves as the workflow trigger for workflows that don't have an automatic trigger.

- To test your workflow before you add an automatic trigger of some kind.
- When you don't want the workflow to run automatically.

Here are some common errors and issues with the Manual Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Only one 'Manual Trigger' node is allowed in a workflow

This error displays if you try to add a Manual Trigger node to a workflow which already includes a Manual Trigger node.

Remove your existing Manual Trigger or edit your workflow to connect that trigger to a different node.

### Updating the Allow External Senders and Auto Subscribe New Members options fails

You can't update the **Allow External Senders** and **Auto Subscribe New Members** options directly after creating a new group. You must wait after creating a group before you can change the values of these options.

When designing workflows that use multiple Microsoft Entra ID nodes to first create groups and then update these options, add a [Wait](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) node between the two operations. A Wait node configured to pause for at least two seconds allows time for the group to fully initialize. After the wait, the update operation can complete without erroring.

## Cohere Model node

**URL:** llms-txt#cohere-model-node

**Contents:**
- Node Options
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

Use the Cohere Model node to use Cohere's models.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Cohere Model node, and links to more resources.

This node lacks tools support, so it won't work with the [AI Agent](../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) node. Instead, connect it with the [Basic LLM Chain](../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/) node.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/cohere/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.
- **Sampling Temperature**: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.

## 4. Setting Values for Processing Orders

**URL:** llms-txt#4.-setting-values-for-processing-orders

**Contents:**
- Add another node before the Airtable node
- Configure the Edit Fields node
- Add data to Airtable
- What's next?

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to select and set data before transferring it to Airtable using the Edit Fields (Set) node. After this step, your workflow should look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.4.json)

The next step in Nathan's workflow is to filter the data to only insert the `employeeName` and `orderID` of all `processing` orders into Airtable.

For this, you need to use the [Edit Fields (Set) node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/), which allows you to select and set the data you want to transfer from one node to another.

The Edit Fields node can set completely new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values into spreadsheets or databases.

## Add another node before the Airtable node

In your workflow, add another node before the **Airtable node** from the **If node** in the same way we did it in the [Filtering Orders](../chapter-5.3/#add-if-node-before-the-airtable-node) lesson on the If node's `true` connector. Feel free to drag the Airtable node further away if your canvas feels crowded.

## Configure the Edit Fields node

Now search for the **Edit Fields (Set) node** after you've selected the **+** sign coming off the If node's `true` connector.

With the Edit Fields node window open, configure these parameters:

- Ensure **Mode** is set to **Manual Mapping**.
- While you can use the **Expression editor** we used in the [Filtering Orders](../chapter-5.3/) lesson, this time, let's drag the fields from the **Input** into the **Fields to Set**:
  - Drag **If** > **orderID** as the first field.
  - Drag **If** > **employeeName** as the second field.
- Ensure that **Include Other Input Fields** is set to false.

Select **Execute step**. You should see the following results:

*Edit Fields (Set) node*

## Add data to Airtable

Next, let's insert these values into Airtable:

1. Go to your Airtable base.

1. Add a new table called `processingOrders`.

1. Replace the existing columns with two new columns:

- `orderID` (primary field): Number
   - `employeeName`: Single line text

If you get stuck, refer to the [Inserting data into Airtable](../chapter-5.2/) lesson.

1. Delete the three empty rows in the new table.

1. In n8n, connect the Edit Fields node **connector to the** Airtable node\*\*.

1. Update the Airtable node configuration to point to the new `processingOrders` table instead of the `orders` table.

1. Test your Airtable node to be sure it inserts records into the new `processingOrders` table.

At this stage, your workflow should now look like this:

## Programmatic-style execute() method

**URL:** llms-txt#programmatic-style-execute()-method

The main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles requests using the `routing` key in the `operations` object.

The `execute()` method creates and returns an instance of `INodeExecutionData`.

You must include input and output item pairing information in the data you return. For more information, refer to [Paired items](../../paired-items/).

Use the Groq Chat Model node to access Groq's large language models for conversational AI and text generation tasks.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Groq Chat Model node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/groq/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Model**: Select the model which will generate the completion. n8n dynamically loads available models from the Groq API. Learn more in the [Groq model documentation](https://console.groq.com/docs/models).

- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.
- **Sampling Temperature**: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.

## Postgres node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#postgres-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Dynamically populate SQL `IN` groups with parameters
- Working with timestamps and time zones
- Outputting Date columns as date strings instead of ISO datetime strings

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Postgres node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Dynamically populate SQL `IN` groups with parameters

In Postgres, you can use the SQL [`IN` comparison construct](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-comparisons.html#FUNCTIONS-COMPARISONS-IN-SCALAR) to make comparisons between groups of values:

While you can use n8n [expressions](../../../../../code/expressions/) in your query to dynamically populate the values in an `IN` group, combining this with [query parameters](../#use-query-parameters) provides extra protection by automatically sanitizing input.

To construct an `IN` group query with query parameters:

1. Set the **Operation** to **Execute Query**.

1. In **Options**, select **Query Parameters**.

1. Use an expression to select an array from the input data. For example, `{{ $json.input_shirt_sizes }}`.

1. In the **Query** parameter, write your query with the `IN` construct with an empty set of parentheses. For example:

1. Inside of the `IN` parentheses, use an expression to dynamically create index-based placeholders (like `$1`, `$2`, and `$3`) for the number of items in your query parameter array. You can do this by increasing each array index by one since the placeholder variables are 1 indexed:

With this technique, n8n automatically creates the correct number of [prepared statement placeholders](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html) for the `IN` values according to the number of items in your array.

## Working with timestamps and time zones

To avoid complications with how n8n and Postgres interpret timestamp and time zone data, follow these general tips:

- **Use UTC when storing and passing dates**: Using UTC helps avoid confusion over timezone conversions when converting dates between different representations and systems.
- **Set the execution timezone**: Set the global timezone in n8n using either [environment variables](../../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/time-zone/) (for self-hosted) or in the [settings](../../../../../manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/) (for n8n Cloud). You can set a workflow-specific timezone in the [workflow settings](../../../../../workflows/settings/).
- **Use ISO 8601 format**: The [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) encodes the day of the month, month, year, hour, minutes, and seconds in a standardized string. n8n passes dates between nodes as strings and uses [Luxon](../../../../../code/cookbook/luxon/) to parse dates. If you need to cast to ISO 8601 explicitly, you can use the [Date & Time node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/) and a custom format set to the string `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss`.

## Outputting Date columns as date strings instead of ISO datetime strings

n8n's uses the [`pg` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) to integrate with Postgres, which affects how n8n processes date, timestamp, and related types from Postgres.

The `pg` package parses `DATE` values into `new Date(row_value)` by default, which produces a date that follows the [ISO 8601 datetime string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations) format. For example, a date of `2025-12-25` might produce a datetime sting of `2025-12-25T23:00:00.000Z` depending on the instance's timezone settings.

To work around this, use the [Postgres `TO_CHAR` function](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-formatting.html#FUNCTIONS-FORMATTING) to format the date into the expected format at query time:

This will produce the date as a string without the time or timezone components. To continue the earlier example, with this casting, a date of `2025-12-25` would produce the string `2025-12-25`. You can find out more in the [`pg` package documentation on dates](https://node-postgres.com/features/types#date--timestamp--timestamptz).

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ('small', 'medium', 'large');
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ();
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ({{ $json.input_shirt_sizes.map((i, pos) => "$" + (pos+1)).join(', ') }});
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
SELECT TO_CHAR(date_col, 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS date_col_as_date FROM table_with_date_col
```

- Using app access token
  - Create a Meta app
  - Generate an App Access Token
  - Configure the Facebook Trigger
  - Optional: Add an App Secret
  - App review
- Common issues
  - Unverified apps limit

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Facebook Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/)

Facebook Graph API credentials

If you want to create credentials for the [Facebook Graph API](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebookgraphapi/) node, follow the instructions in the [Facebook Graph API credentials](../facebookgraph/) documentation.

## Supported authentication methods

Refer to [Meta's Graph API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview) for more information about the service.

## Using app access token

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) account and:

- An app **Access Token**
- An optional **App Secret**: Used to verify the integrity and origin of the payload.

There are five steps in setting up your credential:

1. [Create a Meta app](#create-a-meta-app) with the Webhooks product.
1. [Generate an App Access Token](#generate-an-app-access-token) for that app.
1. [Configure the Facebook trigger](#configure-the-facebook-trigger).
1. Optional: [Add an app secret](#optional-add-an-app-secret).
1. [App Review](#app-review): Only required if your app's users don't have roles on the app itself. If you're creating the app for your own internal purposes, this isn't necessary.

Refer to the detailed instructions below for each step.

### Create a Meta app

To create a Meta app:

1. Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and select **Create App**.
1. If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don’t want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**. The **Use cases** page opens.
1. Select **Other**, then select **Next**.
1. Select **Business** and **Next**.
1. Complete the essential information:
   - Add an **App name**.
   - Add an **App contact email**.
   - Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it.
1. Select **Create app**.
1. The **Add products to your app** page opens.
1. Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
1. Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app "Live.")
1. Select **Save changes**.
1. At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.
1. In the left menu, select **Add Product**.
1. The **Add products to your app** page appears. Select **Webhooks**.
1. The **Webhooks** product opens.

Refer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.

For more information on the app modes and switching to **Live** mode, refer to [App Modes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes) and [Publish | App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release#app-types).

### Generate an App Access Token

Next, create an app access token to be used by your n8n credential and the Webhooks product:

1. In a separate tab or window, open the [Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/).

1. Select the **Meta App** you just created in the **Access Token** section.

1. In **User or Page**, select **Get App Token**.

1. Select **Generate Access Token**.

1. The page prompts you to log in and grant access. Follow the on-screen prompts.

You may receive a warning that the app isn't available. Once you take an app live, there may be a few minutes' delay before you can generate an access token.

1. Copy the token and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**. Save this token somewhere else, too, since you'll need it for the Webhooks configuration.

1. Save your n8n credential.

Refer to the Meta instructions for [Your First Request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/get-started#get-started) for more information on generating the token.

### Configure the Facebook Trigger

Now that you have a token, you can configure the Facebook Trigger node:

1. In your Meta app, copy the **App ID** from the top navigation bar.
1. In n8n, open your Facebook Trigger node.
1. Paste the **App ID** into the **APP ID** field.
1. Select **Execute step** to shift the trigger into listening mode.
1. Return to the tab or window where your Meta app's **Webhooks** product configuration is open.
1. **Subscribe** to the objects you want to receive Facebook Trigger notifications about. For each subscription:
   1. Copy the **Webhook URL** from n8n and enter it as the **Callback URL** in your Meta App.
   1. Enter the **Access Token** you copied above as the **Verify token**.
   1. Select **Verify and save**. (This step fails if you don't have your n8n trigger listening.)
   1. Some webhook subscriptions, like **User**, prompt you to subscribe to individual events. Subscribe to the events you're interested in.
   1. You can send some **Test** events from Meta to confirm things are working. If you send a test event, verify its receipt in n8n.

Refer to the [Facebook Trigger node](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/) documentation for more information.

### Optional: Add an App Secret

For added security, Meta recommends adding an **App Secret**. This signs all API calls with the `appsecret_proof` parameter. The app secret proof is a sha256 hash of your access token, using your app secret as the key.

To generate an App Secret:

1. In Meta while viewing your app, select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
1. Select **Show** next to the **App secret** field.
1. The page prompts you to re-enter your Facebook account credentials. Once you do so, Meta shows the App Secret.
1. Highlight it to select it, copy it, and paste this into your n8n credential as the **App Secret**.
1. **Save** your n8n credential.

Refer to the [App Secret documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/security#appsecret) for more information.

App Review requires Business Verification.

Your app must go through App Review if it will be used by someone who:

- Doesn't have a role on the app itself.
- Doesn't have a role in the Business that has claimed the app.

If your only app users are users who have a role on the app itself, App Review isn't required.

As part of the App Review process, you may need to request advanced access for your webhook subscriptions.

## Plan and Execute Agent node

**URL:** llms-txt#plan-and-execute-agent-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Prompt
  - Require Specific Output Format
- Node options
  - Human Message Template
- Templates and examples
- Common issues

The Plan and Execute Agent is like the [ReAct agent](../react-agent/) but with a focus on planning. It first creates a high-level plan to solve the given task and then executes the plan step by step. This agent is most useful for tasks that require a structured approach and careful planning.

Refer to [AI Agent](../) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

Configure the Plan and Execute Agent using the following parameters.

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

- **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
- **Define below**: If you select this option, provide either static text or an expression for dynamic content to serve as the prompt in the **Prompt (User Message)** field.

### Require Specific Output Format

This parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of these output parsers to the node:

- [Auto-fixing Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/)
- [Item List Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparseritemlist/)
- [Structured Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

Refine the Plan and Execute Agent node's behavior using these options:

### Human Message Template

Enter a message that n8n will send to the agent during each step execution.

Available LangChain expressions:

- `{previous_steps}`: Contains information about the previous steps the agent's already completed.
- `{current_step}`: Contains information about the current step.
- `{agent_scratchpad}`: Information to remember for the next iteration.

## Templates and examples

Refer to the main AI Agent node's [Templates and examples](../#templates-and-examples) section.

## Tips and common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#tips-and-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Combining multiple triggers
- Avoiding evaluation breaking the chat
- Accessing tool data when calculating metrics
- Multiple evaluations in the same workflow
- Dealing with inconsistent results

## Combining multiple triggers

If you have another trigger in the workflow already, you have two potential starting points: that trigger and the [evaluation trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.evaluationtrigger/). To make sure your workflow works as expected no matter which trigger executes, you will need to merge these branches together.

Logic to merge two trigger branches together so that they have the same data format and can be referenced from a single node.

1. **Get the data format of the other trigger**:
   - Execute the other trigger.
   - Open it and navigate to the JSON view of its output pane.
   - Click the **copy** button on the right.
1. **Re-shape the evaluation trigger data to match**:
   - Insert an [Edit Fields (Set) node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) after the evaluation trigger and connect them together.
   - Change its mode to **JSON**.
   - Paste your data into the 'JSON' field, removing the `[` and `]` on the first and last lines.
   - Switch the field type to **Expression**.
   - Map in the data from the trigger by dragging it from the input pane.
   - For strings, make sure to replace the entire value (including the quotes) and add `.toJsonString()` to the end of the expression.
1. **Merge the branches using a 'No-op' node**: Insert a [No-op node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.noop/) and wire both the other trigger and the Set node up to it. The 'No-op' node just outputs whatever input it receives.
1. **Reference the 'No-op' node outputs in the rest of the workflow**: Since both paths will flow through this node with the same format, you can be sure that your input data will always be there.

## Avoiding evaluation breaking the chat

n8n's internal chat reads the output data of the last executed node in the workflow. After adding an evaluation node with the ['set outputs' operation](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.evaluation/#set-outputs), this data may not be in the expected format, or even contain the chat response.

The solution is to add an extra branch coming out of your agent. [Lower branches execute later](../../../flow-logic/execution-order/) in n8n, which means any node you attach to this branch will execute last. You can use a no-op node here since it only needs to pass the agent output through.

## Accessing tool data when calculating metrics

Sometimes you need to know what happened in executed sub-nodes of an agent, for example to check whether it executed a tool. You can't reference these nodes directly with expressions, but you can enable the **Return intermediate steps** option in the agent. This will add an extra output field called `intermediateSteps` which you can use in later nodes:

## Multiple evaluations in the same workflow

You can only have one evaluation set up per workflow. In other words, you can only have one evaluation trigger per workflow.

Even so, you can still test different parts of your workflow with different evaluations by putting those parts in [sub-workflows](../../../flow-logic/subworkflows/) and evaluating each sub-workflow.

## Dealing with inconsistent results

Metrics can often have noise: they may be different across evaluation runs of the exact same workflow. This is because the workflow itself may return different results, or any LLM-based metrics might have natural variation in them.

You can compensate for this by duplicating the rows of your dataset, so that each row appears more than once in the dataset. Since this means that each input will effectively be running multiple times, it will smooth out any variations.

## Chat Trigger node

**URL:** llms-txt#chat-trigger-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Make Chat Publicly Available
  - Mode
  - Authentication
  - Initial Message(s)
- Node options
  - Hosted chat options
  - Embedded chat options
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

Use the Chat Trigger node when building AI workflows for chatbots and other chat interfaces. You can configure how users access the chat, using one of n8n's provided interfaces, or your own. You can add authentication.

You must connect either an agent or chain [root node](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/).

Workflow execution usage

Every message to the Chat Trigger executes your workflow. This means that one conversation where a user sends 10 messages uses 10 executions from your execution allowance. Check your payment plan for details of your allowance.

This node replaces the Manual Chat Trigger node from version 1.24.0.

### Make Chat Publicly Available

Set whether the chat should be publicly available (turned on) or only available through the manual chat interface (turned off).

Leave this turned off while you're building the workflow. Turn it on when you're ready to activate the workflow and allow users to access the chat.

Choose how users access the chat. Select from:

- **Hosted Chat**: Use n8n's hosted chat interface. Recommended for most users because you can configure the interface using the [node options](#node-options) and don't have to do any other setup.
- **Embedded Chat**: This option requires you to create your own chat interface. You can use n8n's [chat widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/chat) or build your own. Your chat interface must call the webhook URL shown in **Chat URL** in the node.

Choose whether and how to restrict access to the chat. Select from:

- **None**: The chat doesn't use authentication. Anyone can use the chat.
- **Basic Auth**: The chat uses basic authentication.
  - Select or create a **Credential for Basic Auth** with a username and password. All users must use the same username and password.
- **n8n User Auth**: Only users logged in to an n8n account can use the chat.

### Initial Message(s)

This parameter's only available if you're using **Hosted Chat**. Use it to configure the message the n8n chat interface displays when the user arrives on the page.

Available options depend on the chat mode.

### Hosted chat options

#### Allowed Origin (CORS)

Set the origins that can access the chat URL. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests.

Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.

#### Input Placeholder, Title, and Subtitle

Enter the text for these elements in the chat interface.

#### Load Previous Session

Select whether to load chat messages from a previous chat session.

If you select any option other than **Off**, you must connect the Chat trigger and the Agent you're using to a memory sub-node. The memory connector on the Chat trigger appears when you set **Load Previous Session** to **From Memory**. n8n recommends connecting both the Chat trigger and Agent to the same memory sub-node, as this ensures a single source of truth for both nodes.

Use this option when building a workflow with steps after the agent or chain that's handling the chat. Choose from:

- **When Last Node Finishes**: The Chat Trigger node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
- **Using Response Nodes**: The Chat Trigger node responds as defined in a [Respond to Chat](../n8n-nodes-langchain.respondtochat/) node or [Respond to Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node. In this response mode, the Chat Trigger will solely show messages as defined in these nodes and not output the data from the last node executed in the workflow.

This mode replaces the 'Using Respond to Webhook Node' mode from version 1.2 of the Chat Trigger node.

- **Streaming response**: Enables real-time data streaming back to the user as the workflow processes. Requires nodes with streaming support in the workflow (for example, the [AI agent](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) node).

#### Require Button Click to Start Chat

Set whether to display a **New Conversation** button on the chat interface (turned on) or not (turned off).

### Embedded chat options

#### Allowed Origin (CORS)

Set the origins that can access the chat URL. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests.

Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.

#### Load Previous Session

Select whether to load chat messages from a previous chat session.

If you select any option other than **Off**, you must connect the Chat trigger and the Agent you're using to a memory sub-node. The memory connector on the Chat trigger appears when you set **Load Previous Session** to **From Memory**. n8n recommends connecting both the Chat trigger and Agent to the same memory sub-node, as this ensures a single source of truth for both nodes.

Use this option when building a workflow with steps after the agent or chain that's handling the chat. Choose from:

- **When Last Node Finishes**: The Chat Trigger node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.

In this response mode, the Chat Trigger will solely show messages as defined in these nodes and not output the data from the last node executed in the workflow.

This mode replaces the 'Using Respond to Webhook Node' mode from version 1.2 of the Chat Trigger node.

- **Streaming response**: Enables real-time data streaming back to the user as the workflow processes. Requires nodes with streaming support enabled.

## Set the chat response manually

You need to manually set the chat response when you don't want to directly send the output of an Agent or Chain node to the user. Instead, you want to take the output of an Agent or Chain node and modify it or do something else with it before sending it back to the user.

In a basic workflow, the Agent and Chain nodes output a parameter named either `output` or `text`, and the Chat trigger sends the value of this parameter to the user as the chat response.

If you need to manually create the response sent to the user, you must create a parameter named either `text` or `output`. If you use a different parameter name, the Chat trigger sends the entire object as its response, not just the value.

When you are using a [Respond to Chat](../n8n-nodes-langchain.respondtochat/) node to manually create the response sent to the user, you must set the Chat Trigger response mode to 'Using Response Nodes'.

## AWS Bedrock Chat Model node

**URL:** llms-txt#aws-bedrock-chat-model-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
- Node options
- Proxy limitations
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

The AWS Bedrock Chat Model node allows you use LLM models utilising AWS Bedrock platform.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the AWS Bedrock Chat Model node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/aws/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Model**: Select the model that generates the completion.

Learn more about available models in the [Amazon Bedrock model documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.html).

- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.
- **Sampling Temperature**: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.

This node doesn't support the [`NO_PROXY` environment variable](../../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/).

## Question and Answer Chain node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#question-and-answer-chain-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- No prompt specified error
- A Retriever sub-node must be connected error
- Can't produce longer responses

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Question and Answer Chain node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## No prompt specified error

This error displays when the **Prompt** is empty or invalid.

You might see this in one of two scenarios:

1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and have an expression in your **Text** that isn't generating a value.
   - To resolve, enter a valid prompt in the **Text** field.
   - Make sure any expressions reference valid fields and that they resolve to valid input rather than null.
1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has null values.
   - To resolve, make sure your input contains a `chatInput` field. Add an [Edit Fields (Set)](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node to edit an incoming field name to `chatInput`.
   - Remove any null values from the `chatInput` field of the input node.

## A Retriever sub-node must be connected error

This error displays when n8n tries to execute the node without having a Retriever connected.

To resolve this, click the + Retriever button at the bottom of your screen when the node is open, or click the Retriever + connector when the node isn't open. n8n will then open a selection of possible Retrievers to pick from.

## Can't produce longer responses

If you need to generate longer responses than the Question and Answer Chain node produces by default, you can try one or more of the following techniques:

- **Connect a more verbose model**: Some AI models produce more terse results than others. Swapping your model for one with a larger context window and more verbose output can increase the word length of your responses.
- **Increase the maximum number of tokens**: Many model nodes (for example the [OpenAI Chat Model](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatopenai/#maximum-number-of-tokens)) include a **Maximum Number of Tokens** option. You can set this to increase the maximum number of tokens the model can use to produce a response.
- **Build larger responses in stages**: For more detailed answers, you may want to construct replies in stages using a variety of AI nodes. You can use AI split up a single question into multiple prompts and create responses for each. You can then compose a final reply by combining the responses again. Though the details are different, you can find a good example of the general idea in this [template for writing a WordPress post with AI](https://n8n.io/workflows/2187-write-a-wordpress-post-with-ai-starting-from-a-few-keywords/).

## Workflow-level executions list

**URL:** llms-txt#workflow-level-executions-list

**Contents:**
- View executions for a single workflow
- Filter executions
- Retry failed workflows

The **Executions** list in a workflow shows all executions for that workflow.

When you delete a workflow, n8n deletes its execution history as well. This means you can't view executions for deleted workflows.

Execution history and workflow history

Don't confuse the execution list with [Workflow history](../../history/).

Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to [Debug and re-run past executions](../debug/) in your current workflow.

Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.

## View executions for a single workflow

In the workflow, select the **Executions** tab in the top menu. You can preview all executions of that workflow.

You can filter the executions list.

1. In your workflow, select **Executions**.
1. Select **Filters**.
1. Enter your filters. You can filter by:
   - **Status**: choose from **Failed**, **Running**, **Success**, or **Waiting**.

- **Execution start**: see executions that started in the given time.

- **Saved custom data**: this is data you create within the workflow using the Code node. Enter the key and value to filter. Refer to [Custom executions data](../custom-executions-data/) for information on adding custom data.

Custom executions data is available on:

- Cloud: Pro, Enterprise
     - Self-Hosted: Enterprise, registered Community

## Retry failed workflows

If your workflow execution fails, you can retry the execution. To retry a failed workflow:

1. Open the **Executions** list.
1. For the workflow execution you want to retry, select **Refresh** .
1. Select either of the following options to retry the execution:
   - **Retry with currently saved workflow**: Once you make changes to your workflow, you can select this option to execute the workflow with the previous execution data.
   - **Retry with original workflow**: If you want to retry the execution without making changes to your workflow, you can select this option to retry the execution with the previous execution data.

## 6. Notifying the Team

**URL:** llms-txt#6.-notifying-the-team

**Contents:**
- What's next?

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to send messages to a Discord channel using the [Discord node](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/). After this step, your workflow should look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.6.json)

Now that you have a calculated summary of the booked orders, you need to notify Nathan's team in their Discord channel. For this workflow, you will send messages to the [n8n server](https://discord.gg/G98WXzsjky) on Discord.

Before you begin the steps below, use the link above to connect to the n8n server on Discord. Be sure you can access the `#course-level-1` channel.

Communication app nodes

You can replace the Discord node with another communication app. For example, n8n also has nodes for [Slack](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/) and [Mattermost](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mattermost/).

In your workflow, add a Discord node connected to the Code node.

When you search for the Discord node, look for **Message Actions** and select **Send a message** to add the node.

In the Discord node window, configure these parameters:

- **Connection Type**: Select **Webhook**.
- **Credential for Discord Webhook**: Select **- Create New Credential -**.
  - Copy the **Webhook URL** from the email you received when you signed up for this course and paste it into the **Webhook URL** field of the credentials.
  - Select **Save** and then close the credentials dialog.
- **Operation**: Select **Send a Message**.
- **Message**:
  - Select the **Expression** tab on the right side of the Message field.

- Copy the text below and paste it into the **Expression** window, or construct it manually using the **Expression Editor**.

Now select **Execute step** in the Discord node. If all works well, you should see this output in n8n:

*Discord node output*

And your message should appear in the Discord channel #course-level-1:

**Nathan 🙋**: Incredible, you've saved me hours of tedious work already! Now I can execute this workflow when I need it. I just need to remember to run it every Monday morning at 9 AM.

**You 👩‍🔧**: Don't worry about that, you can actually schedule the workflow to run on a specific day, time, or interval. I'll set this up in the next step.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
This week we've {{$json["totalBooked"]}} booked orders with a total value of {{$json["bookedSum"]}}. My Unique ID: {{ $('HTTP Request').params["headerParameters"]["parameters"][0]["value"] }}
```

For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

Configure these parameters to configure the node:

- **Session Key**: Enter the key to use to store the memory in the workflow data.
- **Context Window Length**: Enter the number of previous interactions to consider for context.

## Integrations

**Contents:**
- Built-in nodes
- Community nodes
- Credential-only nodes and custom operations
- Generic integrations
- Where to go next

n8n calls integrations nodes.

Nodes are the building blocks of workflows in n8n. They're an entry point for retrieving data, a function to process data, or an exit for sending data. The data process includes filtering, recomposing, and changing data. There can be one or several nodes for your API, service or app. You can connect multiple nodes, which allows you to create complex workflows.

n8n includes a collection of built-in integrations. Refer to [Built-in nodes](builtin/node-types/) for documentation on all n8n's built-in nodes.

As well as using the built-in nodes, you can also install community-built nodes. Refer to [Community nodes](community-nodes/installation/) for more information.

## Credential-only nodes and custom operations

One of the most complex parts of setting up [API](../glossary/#api) calls is managing authentication. n8n provides [credentials](../glossary/#credential-n8n) support for operations and services beyond those supported by built-in nodes.

- Custom operations for existing nodes: n8n supplies hundreds of nodes to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the [HTTP Request](builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.
- Credential-only nodes: n8n includes credential-only nodes. These are integrations where n8n supports setting up credentials for use in the HTTP Request node, but doesn't provide a standalone node. You can find a credential-only node in the nodes panel, as you would for any other integration.

Refer to [Custom operations](custom-operations/) for more information.

## Generic integrations

If you need to connect to a service where n8n doesn't have a node, or a credential-only node, you can still use the [HTTP Request](builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node. Refer to the node page for details on how to set up authentication and create your API call.

- If you want to create your own node, head over to the [Creating Nodes](creating-nodes/overview/) section.
- Check out [Community nodes](community-nodes/usage/) to learn about installing and managing community-built nodes.
- If you'd like to learn more about the different nodes in n8n, their functionalities and example usage, check out n8n's node libraries: [Core nodes](builtin/core-nodes/), [Actions](builtin/app-nodes/), and [Triggers](builtin/trigger-nodes/).
- If you'd like to learn how to add the credentials for the different nodes, head over to the [Credentials](builtin/credentials/) section.

## Webhook node

**Contents:**

- Node parameters
  - Webhook URLs

  - Path
  - Supported authentication methods

  - Response Code
  - Response Data
- Node options

Use the Webhook node to create [webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook), which can receive data from apps and services when an event occurs. It's a trigger node, which means it can start an n8n workflow. This allows services to connect to n8n and run a workflow.

You can use the Webhook node as a trigger for a workflow when you want to receive data and run a workflow based on the data. The Webhook node also supports returning the data generated at the end of a workflow. This makes it useful for building a workflow to process data and return the results, like an API endpoint.

The webhook allows you to trigger workflows from services that don't have a dedicated app trigger node.

## Workflow development process

n8n provides different **Webhook URL**s for testing and production. The testing URL includes an option to **Listen for test event**. Refer to [Workflow development](workflow-development/) for more information on building, testing, and shifting your Webhook node to production.

Use these parameters to configure your node.

The Webhook node has two **Webhook URLs**: test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel.

Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.

Sample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab

- **Test**: n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Listen for Test Event** or **Execute workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the webhook URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
- **Production**: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.

The Webhook node supports standard [HTTP Request Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods):

The webhook maximum payload size is 16MB. If you're self-hosting n8n, you can change this using the [endpoint environment variable](../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/endpoints/) `N8N_PAYLOAD_SIZE_MAX`.

By default, this field contains a randomly generated webhook URL path, to avoid conflicts with other webhook nodes.

You can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs.

The **Path** field can take the following formats:

- `/:variable`
- `/path/:variable`
- `/:variable/path`
- `/:variable1/path/:variable2`
- `/:variable1/:variable2`

### Supported authentication methods

You can require authentication for any service calling your webhook URL. Choose from these authentication methods:

- Basic auth
- Header auth
- JWT auth
- None

Refer to [Webhook credentials](../../credentials/webhook/) for more information on setting up each credential type.

- **Immediately**: The Webhook node returns the response code and the message **Workflow got started**.
- **When Last Node Finishes**: The Webhook node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.
- **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: The Webhook node responds as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.
- **Streaming response**: Enables real-time data streaming back to the user as the workflow processes. Requires nodes with streaming support in the workflow (for example, the [AI agent](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) node).

Customize the [HTTP response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) that the Webhook node returns upon successful execution. Select from common response codes or create a custom code.

Choose what data to include in the response body:

- **All Entries**: The Webhook returns all the entries of the last node in an array.
- **First Entry JSON**: The Webhook returns the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.
- **First Entry Binary**: The Webhook returns the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.
- **No Response Body**: The Webhook returns without a body.

Applies only to **Respond > When Last Node Finishes**.

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options. The available options depend on your node parameters. Refer to the table for option availability.

- **Allowed Origins (CORS)**: Set the permitted cross-origin domains. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests. Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.
- **Binary Property**: Enabling this setting allows the Webhook node to receive binary data, such as an image or audio file. Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to.
- **Ignore Bots**: Ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers.
- **IP(s) Whitelist**: Enable this to limit who (or what) can invoke a Webhook trigger URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IP addresses outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook trigger URL.
- **No Response Body**: Enable this to prevent n8n sending a body with the response.
- **Raw Body**: Specify that the Webhook node will receive data in a raw format, such as JSON or XML.
- **Response Content-Type**: Choose the format for the webhook body.
- **Response Data**: Send custom data with the response.
- **Response Headers**: Send extra headers in the Webhook response. Refer to [MDN Web Docs | Response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) to learn more about response headers.
- **Property Name**: by default, n8n returns all available data. You can choose to return a specific JSON key, so that n8n returns the value.

## How n8n secures HTML responses

Starting with [n8n version 1.103.0](../../../../release-notes/#n8n11030), n8n automatically wraps HTML responses to webhooks in `<iframe>` tags. This is a security mechanism to protect the instance users.

This has the following implications:

- HTML renders in a sandboxed iframe instead of directly in the parent document.
- JavaScript code that attempts to access the top-level window or local storage will fail.
- Authentication headers aren't available in the sandboxed iframe (for example, basic auth). You need to use an alternative approach, like embedding a short-lived access token within the HTML.
- Relative URLs (for example, `<form action="/">`) won't work. Use absolute URLs instead.

## Google Drive Trigger node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#google-drive-trigger-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- 401 unauthorized error
- Handling more than one file change

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Drive Trigger node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## 401 unauthorized error

The full text of the error looks like this:

This error occurs when there's an issue with the credential you're using and its scopes or permissions.

1. For [OAuth2](../../../credentials/google/oauth-single-service/) credentials, make sure you've enabled the Google Drive API in **APIs & Services > Library**. Refer to [Google OAuth2 Single Service - Enable APIs](../../../credentials/google/oauth-single-service/#enable-apis) for more information.
1. For [Service Account](../../../credentials/google/service-account/) credentials:
   1. [Enable domain-wide delegation](../../../credentials/google/service-account/#enable-domain-wide-delegation).
   1. Make sure you add the Google Drive API as part of the domain-wide delegation configuration.

## Handling more than one file change

The Google Drive Trigger node polls Google Drive for changes at a set interval (once every minute by default).

If multiple changes to the **Watch For** criteria occur during the polling interval, a single Google Drive Trigger event occurs containing the changes as items. To handle this, your workflow must account for times when the data might contain more than one item.

You can use an [if node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) or a [switch node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) to change your workflow's behavior depending on whether the data from the Google Drive Trigger node contains a single item or multiple items.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
401 - {"error":"unauthorized_client","error_description":"Client is unauthorized to retrieve access tokens using this method, or client not authorized for any of the scopes requested."}
```

Refer to [SQL Language Reference](https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=SQLRF) for more information about the service.

Refer to [node-oracledb documentation](https://node-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information about the node-oracledb driver.

## Use bind parameters

When creating a statement to run on an Oracle database instance, you can use the **Bind Variable Placeholder Values** field in the **Options** section to load data into the statement. n8n sanitizes data in statement parameters, which prevents SQL injection.

For example, you would want to find specific fruits by their color. Given the following input data:

You can write a statement like:

Then in **Bind Variable Placeholder Values**, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the color from each input item in turn:

## Use n8n Expressions for bind values

For **Values to Send**, you can provide inputs using n8n Expressions. Below are examples for different data types — you can either enter constant values or reference fields from previous items (`$json`):

- Constant: `{{ { k1: "v1", k2: "v2" } }}`
- From a previous item: `{{ $json.COL_JSON }}`

- Constant: `{{ [1, 2, 3, 4.5] }}`
- From a previous item: `{{ $json.COL_VECTOR }}`

- Constant: `{{ [94, 87, 34] }}` or `{{ ' BLOB data string' }}`
- From a previous item: `{{ $json.COL_BLOB }}`

- Constant: `{{ [94, 87, 34] }}`
- From a previous item: `{{ $json.COL_RAW }}`

- Constant: `{{ true }}`
- From a previous item: `{{ $json.COL_BOOLEAN }}`

- Constant: `1234`
- From a previous item: `{{ $json.COL_NUMBER }}`

- Constant: `' Hello World '`
- From a previous item: `{{ $json.COL_CHAR }}`

These examples assume JSON keys (e.g. `COL_JSON, COL_VECTOR`) map directly to the respective SQL column types.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
BEGIN
    demo;
  END;
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
[
    {
        "FRUIT_ID": 1,
        "FRUIT_NAME": "Apple",
        "COLOR": "Red" 
    },
    {
        "FRUIT_ID": 2,
        "FRUIT_NAME": "Banana",
        "COLOR": "Yellow"
    }
]
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
SELECT * FROM FRUITS WHERE COLOR = :col
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
// fruits is an example table name
fruits, {{ $json.color }}
```

## Performance and benchmarking

**URL:** llms-txt#performance-and-benchmarking

**Contents:**
- Performance factors
- Run your own benchmarking
- Example: Single instance performance
- Example: Multi-instance performance

n8n can handle up to 220 workflow executions per second on a single instance, with the ability to scale up further by adding more instances.

This document outlines n8n's performance benchmarking. It describes the factors that affect performance, and includes two example benchmarks.

## Performance factors

The performance of n8n depends on factors including:

- The workflow type
- The resources available to n8n
- How you configure n8n's scaling options

## Run your own benchmarking

To get an accurate estimate for your use case, run n8n's [benchmarking framework](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/%40n8n/benchmark). The repository contains more information about the benchmarking.

## Example: Single instance performance

This test measures how response time increases as requests per second increase. It looks at the response time when calling the Webhook Trigger node.

- Hardware: ECS c5a.large instance (4GB RAM)
- n8n setup: Single n8n instance (running in main mode, with Postgres database)
- Workflow: Webhook Trigger node, Edit Fields node

This graph shows the percentage of requests to the Webhook Trigger node getting a response within 100 seconds, and how that varies with load. Under higher loads n8n usually still processes the data, but takes over 100s to respond.

## Example: Multi-instance performance

This test measures how response time increases as requests per second increase. It looks at the response time when calling the Webhook Trigger node.

- Hardware: seven ECS c5a.4xlarge instances (8GB RAM each)
- n8n setup: two webhook instances, four worker instances, one database instance (MySQL), one main instance running n8n and Redis
- Workflow: Webhook Trigger node, Edit Fields node
- Multi-instance setups use [Queue mode](../queue-mode/)

This graph shows the percentage of requests to the Webhook Trigger node getting a response within 100 seconds, and how that varies with load. Under higher loads n8n usually still processes the data, but takes over 100s to respond.

## HTTP request helper for node builders

**URL:** llms-txt#http-request-helper-for-node-builders

**Contents:**
- Usage
- Example
- Deprecation of the previous helper
- Migration guide to the new helper

n8n provides a flexible helper for making HTTP requests, which abstracts away most of the complexity.

Programmatic style only

The information in this document is for node building using the programmatic style. It doesn't apply to declarative style nodes.

Call the helper inside the `execute` function.

`options` is an object:

`url` is required. The other fields are optional. The default method is `GET`.

Some notes about the possible fields:

- `body`: you can use a regular JavaScript object for JSON payload, a buffer for file uploads, an instance of FormData for `multipart/form-data`, and `URLSearchParams` for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
- `headers`: a key-value pair.
  - If `body` is an instance of `FormData` then n8n adds `content-type: multipart/form-data` automatically.
  - If `body` is an instance of `URLSearchParams`, then n8n adds `content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
  - To override this behavior, set a `content-type` header.
- `arrayFormat`: if your query string contains an array of data, such as `const qs = {IDs: [15,17]}`, the value of `arrayFormat` defines how n8n formats it.
  - `indices` (default): `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a[0]=b&a[1]=c`
  - `brackets`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a[]=b&a[]=c`
  - `repeat`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a=b&a=c`
  - `comma`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a=b,c`
- `auth`: Used for Basic auth. Provide `username` and `password`. n8n recommends omitting this, and using `helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication(...)` instead.
- `disableFollowRedirect`: By default, n8n follows redirects. You can set this to true to prevent this from happening.
- `skipSslCertificateValidation`: Used for calling HTTPS services without proper certificate
- `returnFullResponse`: Instead of returning just the body, returns an object with more data in the following format: `{body: body, headers: object, statusCode: 200, statusMessage: 'OK'}`
- `encoding`: n8n can detect the content type, but you can specify `arrayBuffer` to receive a Buffer you can read from and interact with.

For an example, refer to the [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost/v1/MattermostV1.node.ts).

## Deprecation of the previous helper

The previous helper implementation using `this.helpers.request(options)` used and exposed the `request-promise` library. This was removed in version 1.

To minimize incompatibility, n8n made a transparent conversion to another library called `Axios`.

If you are having issues, please report them in the [Community Forums](https://community.n8n.io/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues).

## Migration guide to the new helper

The new helper is much more robust, library agnostic, and easier to use.

New nodes should all use the new helper. You should strongly consider migrating existing custom nodes to the new helper. These are the main considerations when migrating:

- Accepts `url`. Doesn't accept `uri`.
- `encoding: null` now must be `encoding: arrayBuffer`.
- `rejectUnauthorized: false` is now `skipSslCertificateValidation: true`
- Use `body` according to `content-type` headers to clarify the payload.
- `resolveWithFullResponse` is now `returnFullResponse` and has similar behavior

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
// If no auth needed
const response = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options);

// If auth needed
const response = await this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication.call(
	this, 
	'credentialTypeName', // For example: pipedriveApi
	options,
);
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
{
	url: string;
	headers?: object;
	method?: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE' | 'HEAD';
	body?: FormData | Array | string | number | object | Buffer | URLSearchParams;
	qs?: object;
	arrayFormat?: 'indices' | 'brackets' | 'repeat' | 'comma';
	auth?: {
		username: string,
		password: string,
	};
	disableFollowRedirect?: boolean;
	encoding?: 'arraybuffer' | 'blob' | 'document' | 'json' | 'text' | 'stream';
	skipSslCertificateValidation?: boolean;
	returnFullResponse?: boolean;
	proxy?: {
		host: string;
		port: string | number;
		auth?: {
			username: string;
			password: string;
		},
		protocol?: string;
	};
	timeout?: number;
	json?: boolean;
}
```

Use the Slack Trigger node to respond to events in [Slack](https://slack.com/) and integrate Slack with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Slack events, including new messages, reactions, and new channels.

On this page, you'll find a list of events the Slack Trigger node can respond to and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/slack/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Slack integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/slack-trigger/) page.

- **Any Event**: The node triggers on any event in Slack.
- **Bot / App Mention**: The node triggers when your bot or app is [mentioned](https://slack.com/help/articles/205240127-Use-mentions-in-Slack) in a channel the app is in.
- **File Made Public**: The node triggers when a file is [made public](https://slack.com/help/articles/4412651915539-Manage-public-file-sharing).
- **File Shared**: The node triggers when a file is [shared](https://slack.com/help/articles/201330736-Add-files-to-Slack) in a channel the app is in.
- **New Message Posted to Channel**: The node triggers when a new message is posted to a channel the app is in.
- **New Public Channel Created**: The node triggers when a new [public channel](https://slack.com/help/articles/360017938993-What-is-a-channel) is created.
- **New User**: The node triggers when a new user is added to Slack.
- **Reaction Added**: The node triggers when a [reaction](https://slack.com/help/articles/202931348-Use-emoji-and-reactions) is added to a message the app is added to.

Once you've set the events to trigger on, use the remaining parameters to further define the node's behavior:

- **Watch Whole Workspace**: Whether the node should watch for the selected **Events** in all channels in the workspace (turned on) or not (turned off, default).

This will use one execution for every event in any channel your bot or app is in. Use with caution!

- **Channel to Watch**: Select the channel your node should watch for the selected **Events**. This parameter only appears if you don't turn on **Watch Whole Workspace**. You can select a channel:

- **From list**: The node uses your credential to look up a list of channels in the workspace so you can select the channel you want.
  - **By ID**: Enter the ID of a channel you want to watch. Slack displays the channel ID at the bottom of the channel details with a one-click copy button.
  - **By URL**: Enter the URL of the channel you want to watch, formatted as `https://app.slack.com/client/<channel-address>`.

- **Download Files**: Whether to download files and use them in the node's output (turned on) or not (turned off, default). Use this parameter with the **File Made Public** and **File Shared** events.

You can further refine the node's behavior when you **Add Option**s:

- **Resolve IDs**: Whether to resolve the IDs to their respective names and return them (turned on) or not (turned off, default).
- **Usernames or IDs to ignore**: Select usernames or enter a comma-separated string of encoded user IDs to ignore events from. Choose from the list, or specify IDs using an [expression](../../../../code/expressions/).

n8n provides an app node for Slack. You can find the node docs [here](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/).

View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/slack-trigger/) on n8n's website.

Refer to [Slack's documentation](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/events-api) for details about their API.

To use this node, you need to create an application in Slack and enable event subscriptions. Refer to [Slack credentials | Slack Trigger configuration](../../credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) for more information.

You must add the appropriate scopes to your Slack app for this trigger node to work.

The node requires scopes for the [conversations.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list) and [users.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list) methods at minimum. Check out the [Scopes | Slack credentials](../../credentials/slack/#scopes) list for a more complete list of scopes.

## Verify the webhook

From [version `1.106.0`](../../../../release-notes/#n8n11060), you can set a [Slack Signing Secret](https://api.slack.com/authentication/verifying-requests-from-slack#signing_secrets_admin_page) when configuring your [Slack credentials](../../credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration). When set, the Slack trigger node automatically verifies that requests are from Slack and include a trusted signature. n8n recommends setting this to ensure you only process requests sent from Slack.

Here are some common errors and issues with the Slack Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Workflow only works in testing or production

Slack only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that you can't switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa) without reconfiguring the registered webhook URL.

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Slack will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:

Halts production traffic

This temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.

1. Go to your workflow page.
1. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
1. Edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](../../credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the testing webhook URL instead of the production webhook URL.
1. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
1. When you finish testing, edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](../../credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the production webhook URL instead of the testing webhook URL.
1. Toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

Slack offers **token rotation** that you can turn on for bot and user tokens. This makes every tokens expire after 12 hours. While this may be useful for testing, n8n credentials using tokens with this enabled will fail after expiry. If you want to use your Slack credentials in production, this feature must be **off**.

To check if your Slack app has token rotation turned on, refer to the [Slack API Documentation | Token Rotation](https://api.slack.com/authentication/rotation).

If your app uses token rotation

Please note, if your Slack app uses token rotation, you can't turn it off again. You need to create a new Slack app with token rotation disabled instead.

## Item linking for node creators

**URL:** llms-txt#item-linking-for-node-creators

Programmatic-style nodes only

This guidance applies to programmatic-style nodes. If you're using declarative style, n8n handles paired items for you automatically.

Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. n8n needs to know which input item a given output item comes from. If this information is missing, expressions in other nodes may break. As a node developer, you must ensure any items returned by your node support this.

This applies to programmatic nodes (including trigger nodes). You don't need to consider item linking when building a declarative-style node. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](../../../../integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/) for more information on node styles.

Start by reading [Item linking concepts](../item-linking-concepts/), which provides a conceptual overview of item linking, and details of the scenarios where n8n can handle the linking automatically.

If you need to handle item linking manually, do this by setting `pairedItem` on each item your node returns:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
// Use the pairedItem information of the incoming item
newItem = {
	"json": { . . . },
	"pairedItem": {
		"item": item.pairedItem,
		// Optional: choose the input to use
		// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
		"input": 0
};

// Or set the index manually
newItem = {
		"json": { . . . }
		"pairedItem": {
			"item": i,
			// Optional: choose the input to use
			// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs
			"input": 0
		},
};
```

## Supabase node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#supabase-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Filtering rows by metadata
- Can't connect to a local Supabase database when using Docker
  - If only Supabase is in Docker
  - If Supabase and n8n are running in separate Docker containers
- Records are accessible through Postgres but not Supabase

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Supabase node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Filtering rows by metadata

To filter rows by [Supabase metadata](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/python/metadata), set the **Select Type** to **String**.

From there, you can construct a query in the **Filters (String)** parameter to filter the metadata using the [Supabase metadata query language](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/python/metadata#metadata-query-language), inspired by the [MongoDB selectors](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/) format. Access the metadata properties using the [Postgres `->>` arrow JSON operator](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-PROCESSING) like this (curly brackets denote components to fill in):

For example to access an `age` property in the metadata and return results greater than or equal to 21, you could enter the following in the **Filters (String)** field:

You can combine these operators to construct more complex queries.

## Can't connect to a local Supabase database when using Docker

When you run Supabase in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Supabase.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only Supabase is in Docker

If only Supabase is running in Docker, the Docker Compose file used by the [self-hosting guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) already runs Supabase bound to the correct interfaces.

When configuring [Supabase credentials](../../../credentials/supabase/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **Host** to `localhost`).

### If Supabase and n8n are running in separate Docker containers

If both n8n and Supabase are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure Supabase to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official [Docker compose configuration](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) already does this this). Add both the Supabase and n8n components to the same [user-defined bridge network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/) if you aren't already managing them together in the same Docker Compose file.

When configuring [Supabase credentials](../../../credentials/supabase/), use the Supabase API gateway container's name (`supabase-kong` by default) as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you use the default configuration, you would set the **Host** to `http://supabase-kong:8000`.

## Records are accessible through Postgres but not Supabase

If queries for records return empty using the Supabase node, but are available through the [Postgres](../../n8n-nodes-base.postgres/) node or with a Postgres client, there may be a conflict with Supabase's [Row Level Security (RLS)](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) policy.

Supabase always enables RLS when you create a table in a public schema with the Table Editor. When RLS is active, the API doesn't return any data with the public `anon` key until you create policies. This is a security measure to ensure that you only expose data you intend to.

To access data from a table with RLS enabled as the `anon` role, [create a policy](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security#creating-policies) to enable the access patterns you intend to use.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
metadata->>{your-property}={comparison-operator}.{comparison-value}
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
metadata->>age=gte.21
```

**URL:** llms-txt#n8n-community-node-blocklist

n8n maintains a blocklist of community nodes. You can't install any node on this list.

n8n may add community nodes to the blocklist for a range of reasons, including:

- The node is intentionally malicious
- It's low quality (low enough to be harmful)

If you are a community node creator whose node is on the blocklist, and you believe this is a mistake, contact \[hello@n8n.io\](mailto: hello@n8n.io).

## OpenAI Chat Model node

**URL:** llms-txt#openai-chat-model-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Model
  - Built-in Tools
- Node options
  - Base URL
  - Frequency Penalty
  - Maximum Number of Tokens
  - Response Format
  - Presence Penalty
  - Sampling Temperature

Use the OpenAI Chat Model node to use OpenAI's chat models with conversational [agents](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the OpenAI Chat Model node and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/openai/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

Select the model to use to generate the completion.

n8n dynamically loads models from OpenAI, and you'll only see the models available to your account.

The OpenAI Responses API provides a range of [built-in tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools) to enrich the model's response:

- **Web Search**: Allows models to search the web for the latest information before generating a response.
- **MCP Servers**: Allows models to connect to remote MCP servers. Find out more about using remote MCP servers as tools [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp).
- **File Search**: Allow models to search your knowledgebase from previously uploaded files for relevant information before generating a response. Refer to the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search) for more information.
- **Code Interpreter**: Allows models to write and run Python code in a sandboxed environment.

Use these options to further refine the node's behavior.

Enter a URL here to override the default URL for the API.

### Frequency Penalty

Use this option to control the chances of the model repeating itself. Higher values reduce the chance of the model repeating itself.

### Maximum Number of Tokens

Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.

Choose **Text** or **JSON**. **JSON** ensures the model returns valid JSON.

Use this option to control the chances of the model talking about new topics. Higher values increase the chance of the model talking about new topics.

### Sampling Temperature

Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.

Enter the maximum request time in milliseconds.

Enter the maximum number of times to retry a request.

Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

The conversation that this response belongs to. Input items and output items from this response are automatically added to this conversation after this response completes.

Use this key for caching similar requests to optimize cache hit rates.

### Safety Identifier

Apply an identifier to track users who may violate usage policies.

Select the service tier that fits your needs: Auto, Flex, Default, or Priority.

A set of key-value pairs for storing structured information. You can attach up to 16 pairs to an object, which is useful for adding custom data that can be used for searching by the API or in the dashboard.

Define an integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.

Choose a response format: Text, JSON Schema, or JSON Object. Use of JSON Schema is recommended, if you want to receive data in JSON format.

Configure the prompt filled with a unique ID, its version, and substitutable variables.

Control the reasoning level of AI results: Low, Medium, or High.

Refer to [Creating a custom app](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/app-types/custom-apps) and [Generate access tokens for custom apps in the Shopify admin](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/access-token-types/generate-app-access-tokens-admin) for more information on these steps.

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Shopify partner](https://www.shopify.com/partners) account and:

- A **Client ID**: Generated when you create a custom app.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated when you create a custom app.
- Your **Shop Subdomain**

To set up the credential, you'll need to create and install a custom app:

Custom app development

Shopify provides templates for creating new apps. The instructions below only cover the elements necessary to set up your n8n credential. Refer to Shopify's [Build dev docs](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build) for more information on building apps and working with app templates.

1. Open your [Shopify Partner dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com/).
1. Select **Apps** from the left navigation.
1. Select **Create app**.
1. In the **Use Shopify Partners** section, enter an **App name**.
1. Select **Create app**.
1. When the app details open, copy the **Client ID**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
1. Copy the **Client Secret**. Enter this in your n8n credential.
1. In the left menu, select **Configuration**.
1. In n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and paste it into the **Allowed redirection URL(s)** in the **URLs** section.
1. In the **URLs** section, enter an **App URL** for your app. The host entered here needs to match the host for the **Allowed redirection URL(s)**, like the base URL for your n8n instance.
1. Select **Save and release**.
1. Select **Overview** from the left menu. At this point, you can choose to **Test your app** by installing it to one of your stores, or **Choose distribution** to distribute it publicly.
1. In n8n, enter the **Shop Subdomain** of the store you installed the app to, either as a test or as a distribution.
   - Your subdomain is within the URL: `https://<subdomain>.myshopify.com`. For example, if the full URL is `https://n8n.myshopify.com`, the Shop Subdomain is `n8n`.

Shopify no longer generates API keys with passwords. Use the [Access token](#using-access-token) method instead.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **API Key**
- A **Password**
- Your **Shop Subdomain**: Your subdomain is within the URL: `https://<subdomain>.myshopify.com`. For example, if the full URL is `https://n8n.myshopify.com`, the Shop Subdomain is `n8n`.
- *Optional:* A **Shared Secret**

Here are some common issues setting up the Shopify credential and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Enable custom app development

If you don't see the option to **Create a custom app**, no one's enabled custom app development for your store.

To enable custom app development, you must log in either as a store owner or as a user with the **Enable app development** permission:

1. In Shopify, go to **Admin > Settings >** [**Apps and sales channels**](https://admin.shopify.com/settings/apps).
1. Select **Develop apps**.
1. Select **Allow custom app development**.
1. Read the warning and information provided and select **Allow custom app development**.

### Forbidden credentials error

If you get a **Couldn't connect with these settings / Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials** warning when you test the credentials, this may be due to your app's [access scope](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes) dependencies. For example, the `read_orders` scope also requires `read_products` scope. Review the scopes you have assigned and the action you're trying to complete.

The contents of this file are different depending on whether you're building a declarative-style or programmatic-style node. For guidance on which style to use, refer to [Choose your node building approach](../../../plan/choose-node-method/).

These documents give short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For full walk-throughs of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a declarative-style node](../../declarative-style-node/) or [Build a programmatic-style node](../../programmatic-style-node/).

You can also explore the [n8n-nodes-starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter) and n8n's own [nodes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes) for a wider range of examples. The starter contains basic examples that you can build on. The n8n [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost) is a good example of a more complex programmatic-style node, including versioning.

For all nodes, refer to the:

- OAuth2: Used for public integrations.

Not sure which integration type to use? Refer to [Internal vs. public integrations](#internal-vs-public-integrations) below for more information.

Refer to [Notion's API documentation](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro) for more information about the service.

## Using API integration token

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An **Internal Integration Secret**: Generated once you create a Notion integration.

To generate an integration secret, [create a Notion integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#create-your-integration-in-notion) and grab the integration secret from the **Secrets** tab:

1. Go to your Notion [integration dashboard](https://www.notion.com/my-integrations).
1. Select the **+ New integration** button.
1. Enter a **Name** for your integration, for example `n8n integration`. If desired, add a **Logo**.
1. Select **Submit** to create your integration.
1. Open the **Capabilities** tab. Select these capabilities:
   - `Read content`
   - `Update content`
   - `Insert content`
   - `User information without email addresses`
1. Be sure to **Save changes**.
1. Select the **Secrets** tab.
1. Copy the **Internal Integration Token** and add it as your n8n **Internal Integration Secret**.

Refer to the [Internal integration auth flow setup documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#internal-integration-auth-flow-set-up) for more information about authenticating to the service.

### Share Notion page(s) with the integration

For your integration to interact with Notion, you must [give your integration page permission](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#give-your-integration-page-permissions) to interact with page(s) in your Notion workspace:

1. Visit the page in your Notion workspace.
1. Select the triple dot menu at the top right of a page.
1. In **Connections**, select **Connect to**.
1. Use the search bar to find and select your integration from the dropdown list.

Once you share at least one page with the integration, you can start making API requests. If the page isn't shared, any API requests made will respond with an error.

Refer to [Integration permissions](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#integration-permissions) for more information.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**: Generated once you configure a public integration.
- A **Client Secret**: Generated once you configure a public integration.

You must [create a Notion integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#create-your-integration-in-notion) and set it to public distribution:

1. Go to your Notion [integration dashboard](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).
1. Select the **+ New integration** button.
1. Enter a **Name** for your integration, for example `n8n integration`. If desired, add a **Logo**.
1. Select **Submit** to create your integration.
1. Open the **Capabilities** tab. Select these capabilities:
   - `Read content`
   - `Update content`
   - `Insert content`
   - `User information without email addresses`
1. Select **Save changes**.
1. Go to the **Distribution** tab.
1. Turn on the **Do you want to make this integration public?** control.
1. Enter your company name and website in the **Organization Information** section.
1. Copy the n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** and add it to as a **Redirect URI** in the Notion integration's **OAuth Domain & URLs** section.
1. Go to the **Secrets** tab.
1. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and add them to your n8n credential.

Refer to Notion's [public integration auth flow setup](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#public-integration-auth-flow-set-up) for more information about authenticating to the service.

## Internal vs. public integrations

**Internal** integrations are:

- Specific to a single workspace.
- Accessible only to members of that workspace.
- Ideal for custom workspace enhancements.

Internal integrations use a simpler authentication process (the integration secret) and don't require any security review before publishing.

**Public** integrations are:

- Usable across multiple, unrelated Notion workspaces.
- Accessible by any Notion user, regardless of their workspace.
- Ideal for catering to broad use cases.

Public integrations use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication. They require a Notion security review before publishing.

For a more detailed breakdown of the two integration types, refer to Notion's [Internal vs. Public Integrations documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started#internal-vs-public-integrations).

[Browse Templates and examples integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/remove-duplicates/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)

## Set up sample data using the Code node

Create a workflow with some example input data to try out the Remove Duplicates node.

1. Add a Code node to the canvas and connect it to the Manual Trigger node.

1. In the Code node, set **Mode** to **Run Once for Each Item** and **Language** to **JavaScript**.

1. Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript** field:

1. Add a Split Out node to the canvas and connect it to the Code node.

1. In the Split Out node, enter `data` in the **Fields To Split Out** field.

## Removing duplicates from the current input

1. Add a Remove Duplicates node to the canvas and connect it to the Split Out node. Choose **Remove items repeated within current input** as the **Action** to start.
1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and ensure that the **Operation** is set to **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input**.
1. Choose **All fields** in the **Compare** field.
1. Select **Execute step** to run the Remove Duplicates node, removing duplicated data in the current input.

n8n removes the items that have the same data across all fields. Your output in table view should look like this:

| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |
| 2      | Ed Sheeran    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |
| 3      | Adele         | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z |
| 4      | Bruno Mars    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-08-25T17:45:12.493Z |
| 5      | Billie Eilish | Singer-songwriter | 2024-09-10T09:30:12.493Z |
| 6      | Katy Perry    | Pop star          | 2024-10-08T12:30:45.493Z |
| 7      | Lady Gaga     | Pop star          | 2024-09-15T14:45:30.493Z |
| 8      | Rihanna       | Pop star          | 2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z |

5. Open the Remove Duplicates node again and change the **Compare** parameter to **Selected Fields**.
1. In the **Fields To Compare** field, enter `job`.
1. Select **Execute step** to run the Remove Duplicates node, removing duplicated data in the current input.

n8n removes the items in the current input that have the same `job` data. Your output in table view should look like this:

| **id** | **name**     | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
| ------ | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1      | Taylor Swift | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |
| 2      | Ed Sheeran   | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |

## Keep items where the value is new

1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**.
1. Set the **Keep Items Where** parameter to **Value Is New**.
1. Set the **Value to Dedupe On** parameter to `{{ $json.name }}`.
1. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** to run the workflow. Open the Remove Duplicates node to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. Since this is the first time running the Remove Duplicates node with this operation, n8n processes all data items and places them into the **Kept** output tab. The order of the items may be different than the order in the input data:

| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |
| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |
| 2      | Ed Sheeran    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |
| 2      | Ed Sheeran    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |
| 3      | Adele         | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z |
| 3      | Adele         | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z |
| 4      | Bruno Mars    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-08-25T17:45:12.493Z |
| 5      | Billie Eilish | Singer-songwriter | 2024-09-10T09:30:12.493Z |
| 6      | Katy Perry    | Pop star          | 2024-10-08T12:30:45.493Z |
| 7      | Lady Gaga     | Pop star          | 2024-09-15T14:45:30.493Z |
| 8      | Rihanna       | Pop star          | 2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z |

Items are only compared against previous executions

The current input items are only compared against the stored items from previous executions. This means that items repeated within the current input aren't removed in this mode of operation. If you need to remove duplicate items within the current input *and* across executions, connect two Remove Duplicate nodes together sequentially. Set the first to use the **Remove Items Repated Within Current Input** operation and the second to use the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation.

5. Open the Code node and uncomment (remove the `//` from) the line for "Tom Hanks."
1. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** again. Open the Remove Duplicates node again to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. This time, the **Kept** tab contains the one new record from the Code node:

| **id** | **name**  | **job** | **last_updated**         |
| ------ | --------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| 9      | Tom Hanks | Actor   | 2024-10-17T13:58:31.493Z |

The **Discarded** tab contains the items processed by the previous execution:

| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |

| 3      | Adele         | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z |
| 4      | Bruno Mars    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-08-25T17:45:12.493Z |
| 5      | Billie Eilish | Singer-songwriter | 2024-09-10T09:30:12.493Z |
| 6      | Katy Perry    | Pop star          | 2024-10-08T12:30:45.493Z |
| 7      | Lady Gaga     | Pop star          | 2024-09-15T14:45:30.493Z |
| 8      | Rihanna       | Pop star          | 2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z |

Before continuing, clear the duplication history to get ready for the next example:

7. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Clear Deduplication History**.
1. Select **Execute step** to clear the current duplication history.

## Keep items where the value is higher than any previous value

1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**.
1. Set the **Keep Items Where** parameter to **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**.
1. Set the **Value to Dedupe On** parameter to `{{ $json.id }}`.
1. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** to run the workflow. Open the Remove Duplicates node to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. Since this is the first time running the Remove Duplicates node after clearing the history, n8n processes all data items and places them into the **Kept** output tab. The order of the items may be different than the order in the input data:

| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |

| 8      | Rihanna       | Pop star          | 2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z |
| 9      | Tom Hanks     | Actor             | 2024-10-17T13:58:31.493Z |

5. Open the Code node and uncomment (remove the `//` from) the lines for "Madonna" and "Bob Dylan."
1. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** again. Open the Remove Duplicates node again to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. This time, the **Kept** tab contains a single entry for "Bob Dylan." n8n keeps this item because its `id` column value (15) is higher than any previous values (the previous maximum value was 9):

| **id** | **name**  | **job**     | **last_updated**         |
| ------ | --------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| 15     | Bob Dylan | Folk singer | 2024-09-24T08:03:16.493Z |

The **Discarded** tab contains the 13 items with an `id` column value equal to or less than the previous maximum value (9). Even though it's new, this table includes the entry for "Madonna" because its `id` value isn't larger than the previous maximum value:

| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| 0      | Madonna       | Pop star          | 2024-10-17T17:11:38.493Z |

Before continuing, clear the duplication history to get ready for the next example:

7. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Clear Deduplication History**.
1. Select **Execute step** to clear the current duplication history.

## Keep items where the value is a date later than any previous date

1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the **Operation** to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**.
1. Set the **Keep Items Where** parameter to **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date**.
1. Set the **Value to Dedupe On** parameter to `{{ $json.last_updated }}`.
1. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** to run the workflow. Open the Remove Duplicates node to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions.

5. Open the Code node and uncomment (remove the `//` from) the lines for "Harry Nilsson" and "Kylie Minogue."

1. On the canvas, select **Execute workflow** again. Open the Remove Duplicates node again to examine the results.

n8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. This time, the **Kept** tab contains a single entry for "Kylie Minogue." n8n keeps this item because its `last_updated` column value (`2024-10-24T08:03:16.493Z`) is later than any previous values (the previous latest date was `2024-10-17T17:11:38.493Z`):

| **id** | **name**      | **job**  | **last_updated**         |
| ------ | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| 11     | Kylie Minogue | Pop star | 2024-10-24T08:03:16.493Z |

The **Discarded** tab contains the 15 items with a `last_updated` column value equal to or earlier than the previous latest date (`2024-10-17T17:11:38.493Z`). Even though it's new, this table includes the entry for "Harry Nilsson" because its `last_updated` value isn't later than the previous maximum value:

| **id** | **name**      | **job**           | **last_updated**         |

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Model**: Select the model to use to generate the embedding. Choose from:
  - [all-minilm](https://ollama.com/library/all-minilm) (384 Dimensions)
  - [nomic-embed-text](https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text) (768 Dimensions)

## Pinecone Vector Store node

**URL:** llms-txt#pinecone-vector-store-node

**Contents:**
- Node usage patterns
  - Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents
  - Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool
  - Use a retriever to fetch documents
  - Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions
- Node parameters
  - Operation Mode
  - Rerank Results
  - Get Many parameters
  - Insert Documents parameters

Use the Pinecone node to interact with your Pinecone database as [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store). You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain), or connect directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool). You can also update an item in a vector database by its ID.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Pinecone node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/pinecone/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the Pinecone Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents

You can use the Pinecone Vector Store as a regular node to insert, update, or get documents. This pattern places the Pinecone Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2165-chat-with-pdf-docs-using-ai-quoting-sources/).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the Pinecone Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Pinecone Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Pinecone Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Pinecone Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Pinecone Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Pinecone Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Pinecone Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2705-chat-with-github-api-documentation-rag-powered-chatbot-with-pinecone-and-openai/) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Pinecone Vector store.

This Vector Store node has five modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**, and **Update Documents**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents

Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

#### Update Documents

Use Update Documents mode to update documents in a vector database by ID. Fill in the **ID** with the ID of the embedding entry to update.

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters

- **Pinecone Index**: Select or enter the Pinecone Index to use.
- **Prompt**: Enter your search query.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Insert Documents parameters

- **Pinecone Index**: Select or enter the Pinecone Index to use.

### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters

- **Pinecone Index**: Select or enter the Pinecone Index to use.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters

- **Name**: The name of the vector store.
- **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
- **Pinecone Index**: Select or enter the Pinecone Index to use.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Parameters for **Update Documents**

### Pinecone Namespace

Another segregation option for how to store your data within the index.

Available in **Get Many** mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document.

This is an `AND` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.

When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.

Available in **Insert Documents** mode. Deletes all data from the namespace before inserting the new data.

The Query Submission operation supports query options:

- In the main section of the **Parameters** panel:
  - **Start** controls the index offset to start the query from (to use the API pagination logic).
  - **Limit** sets the maximum number of records to return. Note that the API always has a limit of 30,000 returned records, whatever value you provide.
- In the **Query Options** section, you can activate the following parameters:
  - **Query** lets you specify filter predicates in MongoDB's JSON query format. For example: `{"status": "success", "_submission_time": {"$lt": "2021-11-01T01:02:03"}}` queries for all submissions with the value `success` for the field `status`, and submitted before November 1st, 2021, 01:02:03.
  - **Fields** lets you specify the list of fields you want to fetch, to make the response lighter.
  - **Sort** lets you provide a list of sorting criteria in MongoDB JSON format. For example, `{"status": 1, "_submission_time": -1}` specifies a sort order by ascending status, and then descending submission time.

More details about these options can be found in the [Formhub API docs](<https://github.com/SEL-Columbia/formhub/wiki/Formhub-Access-Points-(API)#api-parameters>)

### Submission options

All operations that return form submission data offer options to tweak the response. These include:

- Download options lets you download any attachment linked to each particular form submissions, such as pictures and videos. It also lets you select the naming pattern, and the file size to download (if available - typically for images).
- Formatting options perform some reformatting as described in [About reformatting](#about-reformatting).

#### About reformatting

The default JSON format for KoboToolbox submission data is sometimes hard to deal with, because it's not schema-aware, and all fields are therefore returned as strings.

This node provides a lightweight opinionated reformatting logic, enabled with the **Reformat?** parameter, available on all operations that return form submissions: the submission query, get, and the attachment download operations.

When enabled, the reformatting:

- Reorganizes the JSON into a multi-level hierarchy following the form's groups. By default, question grouping hierarchy is materialized by a `/` character in the field names, for example `Group1/Question1`. With reformatting enabled, n8n reorganizes these into `Group1.Question1`, as nested JSON objects.
- Renames fields to trim `_` (not supported by many downstream systems).
- Parses all geospatial fields (Point, Line, and Area question types) into their standard GeoJSON equivalent.
- Splits all fields matching any of the **Multiselect Mask** wildcard masks into an array. Since the multi-select fields appear as space-separated strings, they can't be guessed algorithmically, so you must provide a field naming mask. Format the masks as a comma-separated list. Lists support the `*` wildcard.
- Converts all fields matching any of the **Number Mask** wildcard masks into a JSON float.

Here's a detailed example in JSON:

With reformatting enabled, and the appropriate masks for multi-select and number formatting (for example, `Crops_*` and `*_sqm` respectively), n8n parses it into:

## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
1. Select the service you want to connect to.
1. Select your credential.

## n8n node linter

**URL:** llms-txt#n8n-node-linter

**Contents:**
- Setup
- Usage
  - Linting
  - Exceptions

n8n's node linter, [`eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base`](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base), statically analyzes ("lints") the source code of n8n nodes and credentials in the official repository and in community packages. The linter detects issues and automatically fixes them to help you follow best practices.

`eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base` contains a [collection of rules](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base#ruleset) for node files (`*.node.ts`), resource description files (`*Description.ts`), credential files (`*.credentials.ts`), and the `package.json` of a community package.

If using the [n8n node starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter): Run `npm install` in the starter project to install all dependencies. Once the installation finishes, the linter is available to you.

If using VS Code, install the [ESLint VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint). For other IDEs, refer to their ESLint integrations.

Don't edit the configuration file

[`.eslintrc.js`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/.eslintrc.js) contains the configuration for `eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base`. Don't edit this file.

You can use the linter in a community package or in the main n8n repository.

In a community package, the linter runs automatically after installing dependencies and before publishing the package to npm. In the [main n8n repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n), the linter runs automatically using GitHub Actions whenever you push to your pull request.

In both cases, VS Code lints in the background as you work on your project. Hover over a detected issue to see a full description of the linting and a link to further information.

You can also run the linter manually:

- Run `npm run lint` to lint and view detected issues in your console.
- Run `npm run lintfix` to lint and automatically fix issues. The linter fixes violations of rules [marked as automatically fixable](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base#ruleset).

Both commands can run in the root directory of your community package, or in `/packages/nodes-base/` in the main repository.

Instead of fixing a rule violation, you can also make an exception for it, so the linter doesn't flag it.

To make a lint exception from VS Code: hover over the issue and click on `Quick fix` (or `cmd+.` in macOS) and select **Disable {rule} for this line**. Only disable rules for a line where you have good reason to. If you think the linter is incorrectly reporting an issue, please [report it in the linter repository](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base/issues).

To add a lint exception to a single file, add a code comment. In particular, TSLint rules may not show up in VS Code and may need to be turned off using code comments. Refer to the [TSLint documentation](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/rule-flags/) for more guidance.

n8n provides a set of predefined UI components (based on a JSON file) that allows users to input all sorts of data types. The following UI elements are available in n8n.

String field for inputting passwords:

String field with more than one row:

### Support drag and drop for data keys

Users can drag and drop data values to map them to fields. Dragging and dropping creates an [expression](../../../../../glossary/#expression-n8n) to load the data value. n8n supports this automatically.

You need to add an extra configuration option to support dragging and dropping data keys:

- `requiresDataPath: 'single'`: for fields that require a single string.
- `requiresDataPath: 'multiple'`: for fields that can accept a comma-separated list of string.

The [Compare Datasets node code](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/CompareDatasets/CompareDatasets.node.ts) has examples.

Number field with decimal points:

Use the `collection` type when you need to display optional fields.

The `dateTime` type provides a date picker.

The `boolean` type adds a toggle for entering true or false.

The `color` type provides a color selector.

The `options` type adds an options list. Users can select a single value.

The `multiOptions` type adds an options list. Users can select more than one value.

Use this component to evaluate, match, or filter incoming data.

This is the code from n8n's own If node. It shows a filter component working with a [collection](#collection) component where users can configure the filter's behavior.

## Assignment collection (drag and drop)

Use the drag and drop component when you want users to pre-fill name and value parameters with a single drag interaction.

You can see an example in n8n's [Edit Fields (Set) node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/0faeab1228e26d69a2a93bdb2f89523cca1e4036/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Set/v2):

Use the `fixedCollection` type to group fields that are semantically related.

The resource locator element helps users find a specific resource in an external service, such as a card or label in Trello.

The following options are available:

- ID
- URL
- List: allows users to select or search from a prepopulated list. This option requires more coding, as you must populate the list, and handle searching if you choose to support it.

You can choose which types to include.

Refer to the following for live examples:

- Refer to [`CardDescription.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Trello/CardDescription.ts) and [`Trello.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Trello/Trello.node.ts) in n8n's Trello node for an example of a list with search that includes `searchFilterRequired: true`.
- Refer to [`GoogleDrive.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Drive/GoogleDrive.node.ts) for an example where users can browse the list or search.

If your node performs insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. A common pattern is to use a Set node before the node that sends data, to convert the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node, rather than using a Set node. The resource mapper component can also validate input data against the schema provided in the node, and cast input data into the expected type.

Mapping is the process of setting the input data to use as values when updating row(s). Matching is the process of using column names to identify the row(s) to update.

Refer to the [Postgres node (version 2)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Postgres/v2) for a live example using a database schema.

Refer to the [Google Sheets node (version 2)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Sheet/v2) for a live example using a schema-less service.

### Resource mapper type options interface

The `typeOptions` section must implement the following interface:

### Resource mapper method

This method contains your node-specific logic for fetching the data schema. Every node must implement its own logic for fetching the schema, and setting up each UI field according to the schema.

It must return a value that implements the `ResourceMapperFields` interface:

Refer to the [Postgres resource mapping method](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Postgres/v2/methods/resourceMapping.ts) and [Google Sheets resource mapping method](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Sheet/v2/methods/resourceMapping.ts) for live examples.

The HTML editor allows users to create HTML templates in their workflows. The editor supports standard HTML, CSS in `<style>` tags, and expressions wrapped in `{{}}`. Users can add `<script>` tags to pull in additional JavaScript. n8n doesn't run this JavaScript during workflow execution.

Refer to [`Html.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Html/Html.node.ts) for a live example.

Display a yellow box with a hint or extra info. Refer to [Node UI design](../../../plan/node-ui-design/) for guidance on writing good hints and info text.

There are two types of hints: parameter hints and node hints:

- Parameter hints are small lines of text below a user input field.
- Node hints are a more powerful and flexible option than [Notice](#notice). Use them to display longer hints, in the input panel, output panel, or node details view.

### Add a parameter hint

Add the `hint` parameter to a UI element:

Define the node's hints in the `hints` property within the node `description`:

### Add a dynamic hint to a programmatic-style node

In programmatic-style nodes you can create a dynamic message that includes information from the node execution. As it relies on the node output data, you can't display this type of hint until after execution.

For a live example of a dynamic hint in a programmatic-style node, view the [Split Out node code](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Transform/SplitOut/SplitOut.node.ts#L266).

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
{
	displayName: Name, // The value the user sees in the UI
	name: name, // The name used to reference the element UI within the code
	type: string,
	required: true, // Whether the field is required or not
	default: 'n8n',
	description: 'The name of the user',
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names
			],
			operation: [
				// comma-separated list of operation names
			]
		}
	},
}
```

Example 2 (unknown):

	description: `User's password`,
	displayOptions: { // the resources and operations to display this element with
		show: {
			resource: [
				// comma-separated list of resource names

## Schedule Trigger node

**URL:** llms-txt#schedule-trigger-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Seconds trigger interval
  - Minutes trigger interval
  - Hours trigger interval
  - Days trigger interval
  - Weeks trigger interval
  - Months trigger interval
  - Custom (Cron) interval
- Templates and examples
- Common issues

Use the Schedule Trigger node to run workflows at fixed intervals and times. This works in a similar way to the Cron software utility in Unix-like systems.

You must activate the workflow

If a workflow uses the Schedule node as a trigger, make sure that you save and activate the workflow.

The node relies on the timezone setting. n8n uses either:

1. The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to [Workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/) for more information.
1. The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is `America/New York` for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using [Environment variables](../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/). Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the [Admin dashboard](../../../../manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/).

Add **Trigger Rules** to determine when the trigger should run.

Use the **Trigger Interval** to select the time interval unit of measure to schedule the trigger for. All other parameters depend on the interval you select. Choose from:

- [Seconds trigger interval](#seconds-trigger-interval)
- [Minutes trigger interval](#minutes-trigger-interval)
- [Hours trigger interval](#hours-trigger-interval)
- [Days trigger interval](#days-trigger-interval)
- [Weeks trigger interval](#weeks-trigger-interval)
- [Months trigger interval](#months-trigger-interval)
- [Custom (Cron) interval](#custom-cron-interval)

You can add multiple **Trigger Rules** to run the node on different schedules.

Refer to the sections below for more detail on configuring each **Trigger Interval**. Refer to [Templates and examples](#templates-and-examples) for further examples.

### Seconds trigger interval

- **Seconds Between Triggers**: Enter the number of seconds between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter `30` here, the trigger will run every 30 seconds.

### Minutes trigger interval

- **Minutes Between Triggers**: Enter the number of minutes between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter `5` here, the trigger will run every 5 minutes.

### Hours trigger interval

- **Hours Between Triggers**: Enter the number of hours between each workflow trigger.
- **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `6` **Hours Between Triggers** and `30` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every six hours at 30 minutes past the hour.

### Days trigger interval

- **Days Between Triggers**: Enter the number of days between each workflow trigger.
- **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
- **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `2` **Days Between Triggers**, **9am** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `15` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every two days at 9:15am.

### Weeks trigger interval

- **Weeks Between Triggers**: Enter the number of weeks between each workflow trigger.
- **Trigger on Weekdays**: Select the day(s) of the week you want to trigger the node.
- **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
- **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `2` **Weeks Between Triggers**, **Monday** for **Trigger on Weekdays**, **3pm** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `30` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every two weeks on Monday at 3:30 PM.

### Months trigger interval

- **Months Between Triggers**: Enter the number of months between each workflow trigger.
- **Trigger at Day of Month**: Enter the day of the month the day should trigger at, from `1` to `31`. If a month doesn't have this day, the node won't trigger. For example, if you enter `30` here, the node won't trigger in February.
- **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.
- **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.

For example, if you enter `3` **Months Between Triggers**, `28` **Trigger at Day of Month**, **9am** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `0` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run each quarter on the 28th day of the month at 9:00 AM.

### Custom (Cron) interval

Enter a custom cron **Expression** to set the schedule for the trigger.

To generate a Cron expression, you can use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru). Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the **Expression** field in n8n.

| Type                | Cron Expression    | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Every X Seconds     | `*/10 * * * * *`   | Every 10 seconds.                                            |
| Every X Minutes     | `*/5 * * * *`      | Every 5 minutes.                                             |
| Hourly              | `0 * * * *`        | Every hour on the hour.                                      |
| Daily               | `0 6 * * *`        | At 6:00 AM every day.                                        |
| Weekly              | `0 12 * * 1`       | At noon every Monday.                                        |
| Monthly             | `0 0 1 * *`        | At midnight on the 1st of every month.                       |
| Every X Days        | `0 0 */3 * *`      | At midnight every 3rd day.                                   |
| Only Weekdays       | `0 9 * * 1-5`      | At 9:00 AM Monday through Friday.                            |
| Custom Hourly Range | `0 9-17 * * *`     | Every hour from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day.                |
| Quarterly           | `0 0 1 1,4,7,10 *` | At midnight on the 1st of January, April, July, and October. |

Using variables in the Cron expression

While variables can be used in the scheduled trigger, their values only get evaluated when the workflow is activated. If you alter a variable's value in the settings after a workflow is activated, the changes won't alter the cron schedule. To re-evaluate the variable, set the workflow to **Inactive** and then back to **Active** again

#### Why there are six asterisks in the Cron expression

The sixth asterisk in the Cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.

| (\*)     | \*     | \*   | \*           | \*    | \*                   |
| -------- | ------ | ---- | ------------ | ----- | -------------------- |
| (second) | minute | hour | day of month | month | day of week(Sun-Sat) |

## Google Sheets Trigger node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#google-sheets-trigger-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Stuck waiting for trigger event
- Date and time columns are rendering as numbers

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Sheets Trigger node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Stuck waiting for trigger event

When testing the Google Sheets Trigger node with the **Execute step** or **Execute workflow** buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.

Stuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.

To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.

## Date and time columns are rendering as numbers

Google Sheets can render dates and times a few different ways.

The [**serial number** format](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/DateTimeRenderOption), popularized by Lotus 1-2-3 and used my types of spreadsheet software, represents dates as a decimal number. The whole number component (the part left of the decimal) represents the number of days since December 30, 1899. The decimal portion (the part right of the decimal) represents time as a portion of a 24-hour period (for example, `.5` represents noon).

To use a different format for date and time values, adjust the format in your Google Sheet Trigger node. This is available when **Trigger On** is set to **Row Added**:

1. Open the Google Sheet Trigger node on your canvas.
1. Select **Add option**.
1. Select **DateTime Render**.
1. Change **DateTime Render** to **Formatted String**.

The Google Sheets Trigger node will now format date, time, datetime, and duration fields as strings according to their number format.

The number format depends on the spreadsheet's locale settings. You can change the local by opening the spreadsheet and selecting **File > Settings**. In the **General** tab, set **Locale** to your preferred locale. Select **Save settings** to adjust the value.

## Data flow within nodes

**URL:** llms-txt#data-flow-within-nodes

Nodes can process multiple items.

For example, if you set the Trello node to `Create-Card`, and create an expression that sets `Name` using a property called `name-input-value` from the incoming data, the node creates a card for each item, always choosing the `name-input-value` of the current item.

For example, this input will create two cards. One named `test1` the other one named `test2`:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
[
	{
		name-input-value: "test1"
	},
	{
		name-input-value: "test2"
	}
]
```

## Chat with a Google Sheet using AI

**URL:** llms-txt#chat-with-a-google-sheet-using-ai

**Contents:**
- Key features
- Using the example

Use n8n to bring your own data to AI. This workflow uses the [Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) to provide the chat interface, and the [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) to call a second workflow that queries Google Sheets.

[View workflow file](/_workflows/advanced-ai/examples/chat_with_google_sheets_docs_version.json)

- [Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/): start your workflow and respond to user chat interactions. The node provides a customizable chat interface.
- [Agent](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): the key piece of the AI workflow. The Agent interacts with other components of the workflow and makes decisions about what tools to use.
- [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/): plug in n8n workflows as custom tools. In AI, a tool is an interface the AI can use to interact with the world (in this case, the data provided by your workflow). The AI model uses the tool to access information beyond its built-in dataset.

To load the template into your n8n instance:

1. Download the workflow JSON file.
1. Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.
1. Copy in the JSON, or select **Workflow menu** > **Import from file...**.

The example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:

- Yellow: notes and information.
- Green: instructions to run the workflow.
- Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.
- Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example.

## Activation Trigger node

**URL:** llms-txt#activation-trigger-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
- Templates and examples

The Activation Trigger node gets triggered when an event gets fired by n8n or a workflow.

n8n has deprecated the Activation Trigger node and replaced it with two new nodes: the [n8n Trigger node](../n8n-nodes-base.n8ntrigger/) and the [Workflow Trigger node](../n8n-nodes-base.workflowtrigger/). For more details, check out the entry in the [breaking changes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#01170) page.

If you want to use the Activation Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.

The Activation Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Activation Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.

- Events
  - **Activation**: Run when the workflow gets activated
  - **Start**: Run when n8n starts or restarts
  - **Update**: Run when the workflow gets saved while it's active

## Configure workflow timeout settings

**URL:** llms-txt#configure-workflow-timeout-settings

A workflow times out and gets canceled after this time (in seconds). If the workflow runs in the main process, a soft timeout happens (takes effect after the current node finishes). If a workflow runs in its own process, n8n attempts a soft timeout first, then kills the process after waiting for a fifth of the given timeout duration.

`EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT` default is `-1`. For example, if you want to set the timeout to one hour:

You can also set maximum execution time (in seconds) for each workflow individually. For example, if you want to set maximum execution time to two hours:

Refer to [Environment variables reference](../../environment-variables/executions/) for more information on these variables.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
export EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT=3600
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
export EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT_MAX=7200
```

## Qdrant Vector Store node

**URL:** llms-txt#qdrant-vector-store-node

**Contents:**
- Node usage patterns
  - Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents
  - Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool
  - Use a retriever to fetch documents
  - Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions
- Node parameters
  - Operation Mode
  - Rerank Results
  - Get Many parameters
  - Insert Documents parameters

Use the Qdrant node to interact with your Qdrant collection as a [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store). You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain) or connect it directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to use as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Qdrant node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/qdrant/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the Qdrant Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents

You can use the Qdrant Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Qdrant Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in the first part of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2440-building-rag-chatbot-for-movie-recommendations-with-qdrant-and-open-ai/).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the Qdrant Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Qdrant Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Qdrant Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Qdrant Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2183-ai-crew-to-automate-fundamental-stock-analysis-qanda-workflow/) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Qdrant Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Qdrant Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Qdrant Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2464-scale-deal-flow-with-a-pitch-deck-ai-vision-chatbot-and-qdrant-vector-store/) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Qdrant Vector store.

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt is embedded and used for similarity search. The node returns the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents

Use insert documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Tool for AI Agent)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters

- **Qdrant collection name**: Enter the name of the Qdrant collection to use.
- **Prompt**: Enter the search query.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

This Operation Mode includes one **Node option**, the [Metadata Filter](#metadata-filter).

### Insert Documents parameters

- **Qdrant collection name**: Enter the name of the Qdrant collection to use.

This Operation Mode includes one **Node option**:

- **Collection Config**: Enter JSON options for creating a Qdrant collection creation configuration. Refer to the Qdrant [Collections](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/collections/) documentation for more information.

### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters

- **Qdrant Collection**: Enter the name of the Qdrant collection to use.

This Operation Mode includes one **Node option**, the [Metadata Filter](#metadata-filter).

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters

- **Name**: The name of the vector store.
- **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
- **Qdrant Collection**: Enter the name of the Qdrant collection to use.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

Available in **Get Many** mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document.

This is an `AND` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.

When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.

Breaking changes in versions

Node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes. If you find that an upgrade causes issues, you can [downgrade](#upgrade-or-downgrade-to-a-specific-version).

### Upgrade to the latest version

Access your Docker shell:

### Upgrade or downgrade to a specific version

Access your Docker shell:

Run npm uninstall to remove the current version:

## Discord node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#discord-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Add extra fields to embeds
- Mention users and channels

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Discord node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Add extra fields to embeds

Discord messages can optionally include embeds, a rich preview component that can include a title, description, image, link, and more.

The Discord node supports embeds when using the **Send** operation on the **Message** resource. Select **Add Embeds** to set extra fields including Description, Author, Title, URL, and URL Image.

To add fields that aren't included by default, set **Input Method** to **Raw JSON**. From here, add a JSON object to the **Value** parameter defining the [field names](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/message#embed-object) and values you want to include.

For example, to include `footer` and `fields`, neither of which are available using the **Enter Fields** Input Method, you could use a JSON object like this:

You can learn more about embeds in [Using Webhooks and Embeds | Discord](https://discord.com/safety/using-webhooks-and-embeds).

If you experience issues when working with embeds with the Discord node, you can use the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) with your existing Discord credentials to `POST` to the following URL:

In the body, include your embed information in the message content like this:

## Mention users and channels

To mention users and channels in Discord messages, you need to format your message according to [Discord's message formatting guidelines](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#message-formatting).

To mention a user, you need to know the Discord user's user ID. Keep in mind that the user ID is different from the user's display name. Similarly, you need a channel ID to link to a specific channel.

You can learn how to enable developer mode and copy the user or channel IDs in [Discord's documentation on finding User/Server/Message IDs](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID).

Once you have the user or channel ID, you can format your message with the following syntax:

- **User**: `<@USER_ID>`
- **Channel**: `<#CHANNEL_ID>`
- **Role**: `<@&ROLE_ID>`

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
{
    "author": "My Name",
	"url": "https://discord.js.org",
	"fields": [
		{
			"name": "Regular field title",
			"value": "Some value here"
		}
	],
	"footer": {
		"text": "Some footer text here",
		"icon_url": "https://i.imgur.com/AfFp7pu.png"
	}
}
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
https://discord.com/api/v10/channels/<CHANNEL_ID>/messages
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
{
	"content": "Test",
	"embeds": [
		{
			"author": "My Name",
			"url": "https://discord.js.org",
			"fields": [
				{
					"name": "Regular field title",
					"value": "Some value here"
				}
			],

**Contents:**
- Accessing workflow diffs
- Understanding the workflow diff view
  - When pushing
  - When pulling
- Reviewing node changes
- Viewing the summary of changes
- Navigating through each change
- Who can use workflow diffs

Workflow diffs allow you to visually compare changes between the workflow you have on an instance and the most recent version saved in your connected Git repository. This helps you understand the exact changes to the workflow before you decide to either push or pull it across different environments.

- Available on Enterprise
- Workflow diffs are only available when you [enable the environments features](../../setup/) on an instance

## Accessing workflow diffs

You can access workflow diffs from two locations:

1. **When pushing changes**: Click the workflow diff icon in the commit modal alongside the workflow you want to review
1. **When pulling changes**: Click the workflow diff icon in the modified changes modal alongside the workflow you want to review

## Understanding the workflow diff view

When you open a workflow diff, n8n displays two workflows stacked vertically:

- **Top panel** (Remote branch): Latest version in your Git repository
- **Bottom panel** (Local): Current locally saved version of the workflow

- **Top panel** (Local): Current version on your n8n instance
- **Bottom panel** (Remote branch): Version you're pulling from the Git repository

In both cases, the top panel always displays the workflow that will update with changes.

The diff view highlights three types of changes:

- **Added nodes and connectors**: New node additions or connectors will show as green along with an "N" icon
- **Modified nodes and connectors**: Modifications to existing nodes or connectors will show as orange along with a "M" icon
- **Deleted nodes and connectors**: Node or connector deletions will show as red along with a "D" icon

## Reviewing node changes

For modified nodes, you can also compare the specific changes. Click modified nodes to show a JSON diff of the changes. You can review the exact configuration for that node before and after the given change.

## Viewing the summary of changes

In the top-right corner, the **changes** button shows the number of changes. This represents the total number of changes across node and node connectors, as well as general workflow settings updates.

## Navigating through each change

You can use the **next** and **previous** arrows in the upper-right corner to cycle through your changes in a logical order. Use the **back** button in the top-left corner to return to the commit or pull modal to select a different workflow to review changes on.

## Who can use workflow diffs

Only users who can push or pull commits for an instance can access workflow diffs:

- instance owners
- instance admins
- project admins

## Google Gemini Chat Model node

**URL:** llms-txt#google-gemini-chat-model-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
- Node options
- Limitations
  - No proxy support
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

Use the Google Gemini Chat Model node to use Google's Gemini chat models with conversational agents.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Google Gemini Chat Model node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/googleai/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Model**: Select the model to use to generate the completion.

n8n dynamically loads models from the Google Gemini API and you'll only see the models available to your account.

- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.
- **Sampling Temperature**: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.
- **Top K**: Enter the number of token choices the model uses to generate the next token.
- **Top P**: Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.
- **Safety Settings**: Gemini supports adjustable safety settings. Refer to Google's [Gemini API safety settings](https://ai.google.dev/docs/safety_setting_gemini) for information on the available filters and levels.

The Google Gemini Chat Model node uses Google's SDK, which doesn't support proxy configuration.

If you need to proxy your connection, as a work around, you can set up a dedicated reverse proxy for Gemini requests and change the **Host** parameter in your [Google Gemini credentials](../../../credentials/googleai/) to point to your proxy address:

## Wikipedia node

**URL:** llms-txt#wikipedia-node

**Contents:**
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

The Wikipedia node is a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) that allows an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to search and return information from Wikipedia.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Dirty nodes

**URL:** llms-txt#dirty-nodes

**Contents:**
- How to recognize dirty node data
- Why n8n marks nodes dirty
- Resolving dirty nodes

A **dirty node** is a node that executed successfully in the past, but whose output n8n now considers stale or unreliable. They're labeled like this to indicate that if the node executes again, the output may be different. It may also be the point where a [partial execution](../manual-partial-and-production-executions/#partial-executions) starts from.

## How to recognize dirty node data

In the canvas of the workflow editor, you can identify dirty notes by their different-colored border and a yellow triangle in place of the previous green tick symbol. For example:

In the node editor view, the output panel also displays a yellow triangle on the output panel. If you hover over the triangle, a tooltip appears with more information about why n8n considers the data stale:

## Why n8n marks nodes dirty

There are several reasons why n8n might flag execution data as stale. For example:

- Inserting or deleting a node: labels the first node that follows the inserted node dirty.
- Modifying node parameters: labels the modified node dirty.
- Adding a connector: labels the destination node of the new connector dirty.
- Deactivating a node: labels the first node that follows the deactivated node dirty.

Other reasons n8n marks nodes dirty

- Unpinning a node: labels the unpinned node dirty.
- Modifying pinned data: labels the node that comes after the pinned data dirty.
- If any of the above actions occur inside a loop, also labels the first node of the loop dirty.

For sub-nodes, also labels any executed parent nodes (up to and including the root) when:

- Editing an executed sub-node

- Adding a new sub-node

- Disconnecting or deleting a sub-node

- Deactivating a sub-node

- Activating a sub-node

- When deleting a connected node in a workflow:

- The next node in the sequence becomes dirty:

When using loops (with the [Loop over Items](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node), when any node within the loop is dirty, the initial node of the loop is also considered dirty:

## Resolving dirty nodes

Executing a node again clears its dirty status. You can do this manually by triggering the whole workflow, or by running a [partial execution](../manual-partial-and-production-executions/#partial-executions) with **Execute step** on the individual node or any node which follows it.

## Trello Trigger node

**URL:** llms-txt#trello-trigger-node

**Contents:**
- Find the Model ID

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a web-based Kanban-style list-making application which is a subsidiary of Atlassian. Users can create their task boards with different columns and move the tasks between them.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/trello/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Trello Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/trello-trigger/) page.

The model ID is the ID of any model in Trello. Depending on the use-case, it could be the User ID, List ID, and so on.

For this specific example, the List ID would be the Model ID:

1. Open the Trello board that contains the list.
1. If the list doesn't have any cards, add a card to the list.
1. Open the card, add `.json` at the end of the URL, and press enter.
1. In the JSON file, you will see a field called `idList`.
1. Copy `idList`and paste it in the **Model ID** field in n8n.

## Streaming responses

**URL:** llms-txt#streaming-responses

**Contents:**
- Configure nodes for streaming
- Important information

Available on all plans from [version 1.105.2](../../release-notes/#n8n11052).

Streaming responses let you send data back to users as an AI Agent node generates it. This is useful for chatbots, where you want to show the user the answer as it's generated to provide a better user experience.

You can enable streaming using either:

- The [Chat Trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/)
- The [Webhook node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/)

In both cases, set the node's **Response Mode** to **Streaming**.

## Configure nodes for streaming

To stream data, you need to add nodes to the workflow that support streaming output. Not all nodes support this feature.

1. Choose a node that supports streaming, such as:
   - [AI agent](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/)
   - [Respond to Webhook](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/)
1. You can disable streaming in the options of these nodes. By default, they stream data whenever the executed trigger has its `Response Mode` set to `Streaming response`.

## Important information

Keep in mind the following details when configuring streaming responses:

- **Trigger**: Your trigger node must support streaming and have streaming configured. Without this, the workflow behaves according to your response mode settings.
- **Node configuration**: Even with streaming enabled on the trigger, you need at least one node configured to stream data. Otherwise, your workflow will send no data.

n8n provides a trigger node for Postgres. You can find the trigger node docs [here](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgrestrigger/).

## Use query parameters

When creating a query to run on a Postgres database, you can use the **Query Parameters** field in the **Options** section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.

For example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:

You can write a query like:

Then in **Query Parameters**, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](common-issues/).

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
[
    {
        "email": "alex@example.com",
        "name": "Alex",
        "age": 21 
    },
    {
        "email": "jamie@example.com",
        "name": "Jamie",
        "age": 33 
    }
]
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
SELECT * FROM $1:name WHERE email = $2;
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
// users is an example table name
{{ [ 'users', $json.email ] }}

## Schema Preview

**URL:** llms-txt#schema-preview

**Contents:**
- Using the preview

Schema Preview exposes expected schema data from the previous node in the Node Editor without the user having to provide credentials or execute the node. This makes it possible to construct workflows without having to provide credentials in advance. The preview doesn't include mock data, but it does expose the expected fields, making it possible to select and incorporate them into the input of subsequent nodes.

1. There must be a node with Schema Preview available in your workflow.
1. When clicking on the details of the next node in the sequence, the Schema Preview data will show up in the Node Editor where schema data would typically be exposed.
1. Use data from the Schema Preview just as you would other schemas - drag and drop fields as input into your node parameters and settings.

## Item List Output Parser node

**URL:** llms-txt#item-list-output-parser-node

**Contents:**
- Node options
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

Use the Item List Output Parser node to return a list of items with a specific length and separator.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Number of Items**: Enter the maximum items to return. Set to `-1` for unlimited items.
- **Separator**: Select the separator used to split the results into separate items. Defaults to a new line.

## `getWorkflowStaticData(type)`

**URL:** llms-txt#`getworkflowstaticdata(type)`

This gives access to the static workflow data.

- Static data isn't available when testing workflows. The workflow must be active and called by a [trigger](../../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n) or webhook to save static data.
- This feature may behave unreliably under high-frequency workflow executions.

You can save data directly in the workflow. This data should be small.

As an example: you can save a timestamp of the last item processed from an RSS feed or database. It will always return an object. Properties can then read, delete or set on that object. When the workflow execution succeeds, n8n checks automatically if the data has changed and saves it, if necessary.

There are two types of static data, global and node. Global static data is the same in the whole workflow. Every node in the workflow can access it. The node static data is unique to the node. Only the node that set it can retrieve it again.

Example with global data:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
// Get the global workflow static data
const workflowStaticData = $getWorkflowStaticData('global');

// Access its data
const lastExecution = workflowStaticData.lastExecution;

// Update its data
workflowStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime();

// Delete data
delete workflowStaticData.lastExecution;
```

Use the xAI Grok Chat Model node to access xAI Grok's large language models for conversational AI and text generation tasks.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the xAI Grok Chat Model node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/xai/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Model**: Select the model which will generate the completion. n8n dynamically loads available models from the xAI Grok API. Learn more in the [xAI Grok model documentation](https://docs.x.ai/docs/models).

- **Frequency Penalty**: Use this option to control the chances of the model repeating itself. Higher values reduce the chance of the model repeating itself.
- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length. Most models have a context length of 2048 tokens with the newest models supporting up to 32,768 tokens.
- **Response Format**: Choose **Text** or **JSON**. **JSON** ensures the model returns valid JSON.
- **Presence Penalty**: Use this option to control the chances of the model talking about new topics. Higher values increase the chance of the model talking about new topics.
- **Sampling Temperature**: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.
- **Timeout**: Enter the maximum request time in milliseconds.
- **Max Retries**: Enter the maximum number of times to retry a request.
- **Top P**: Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

## Basic LLM Chain node

**URL:** llms-txt#basic-llm-chain-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Prompt
  - Require Specific Output Format
- Chat Messages
- Templates and examples
- Related resources
- Common issues
  - No prompt specified error

Use the Basic LLM Chain node to set the prompt that the model will use along with setting an optional parser for the response.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Basic LLM Chain node and links to more resources.

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Basic LLM Chain integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/basic-llm-chain/) page.

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

- **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
- **Define below**: If you select this option, provide either static text or an expression for dynamic content to serve as the prompt in the **Prompt (User Message)** field.

### Require Specific Output Format

This parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of these output parsers to the node:

- [Auto-fixing Output Parser](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/)
- [Item List Output Parser](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparseritemlist/)
- [Structured Output Parser](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

Use **Chat Messages** when you're using a chat model to set a message.

n8n ignores these options if you don't connect a chat model. Select the **Type Name or ID** you want the node to use:

Enter a sample expected response in the **Message** field. The model will try to respond in the same way in its messages.

Enter a system **Message** to include with the user input to help guide the model in what it should do.

Use this option for things like defining tone, for example: `Always respond talking like a pirate`.

Enter a sample user input. Using this with the AI option can help improve the output of the agent. Using both together provides a sample of an input and expected response (the **AI Message**) for the model to follow.

Select one of these input types:

- **Text**: Enter a sample user input as a text **Message**.
- **Image (Binary)**: Select a binary input from a previous node. Enter the **Image Data Field Name** to identify which binary field from the previous node contains the image data.
- **Image (URL)**: Use this option to feed an image in from a URL. Enter the **Image URL**.

For both the **Image** types, select the **Image Details** to control how the model processes the image and generates its textual understanding. Choose from:

- **Auto**: The model uses the auto setting, which looks at the image input size and decide if it should use the Low or High setting.
- **Low**: The model receives a low-resolution 512px x 512px version of the image and represents the image with a budget of 65 tokens. This allows the API to return faster responses and consume fewer input tokens. Use this option for use cases that don't require high detail.
- **High**: The model can access the low-resolution image and then creates detailed crops of input images as 512px squares based on the input image size. Each of the detailed crops uses twice the token budget (65 tokens) for a total of 129 tokens. Use this option for use cases that require high detail.

Here are some common errors and issues with the Basic LLM Chain node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### No prompt specified error

This error displays when the **Prompt** is empty or invalid.

You might see this error in one of two scenarios:

1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and haven't entered anything in the **Text** field.
   - To resolve, enter a valid prompt in the **Text** field.
1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has no field called `chatInput`.
   - The node expects the `chatInput` field. If your previous node doesn't have this field, add an [Edit Fields (Set)](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node to edit an incoming field name to `chatInput`.

## PGVector Vector Store node

**URL:** llms-txt#pgvector-vector-store-node

**Contents:**
- Node usage patterns
  - Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents
  - Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool
  - Use a retriever to fetch documents
  - Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions
- Node parameters
  - Operation Mode
  - Rerank Results
  - Get Many parameters
  - Insert Documents parameters

PGVector is an extension of Postgresql. Use this node to interact with the PGVector tables in your Postgresql database. You can insert documents into a vector table, get documents from a vector table, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain), or connect directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the PGVector node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/postgres/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the PGVector Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents

You can use the PGVector Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the PGVector Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (the template uses the Supabase Vector Store, but the pattern is the same).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the PGVector Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> PGVector Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the PGVector Vector Store node to fetch documents from the PGVector Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> PGVector Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the PGVector Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the PGVector Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/) (the linked example uses the Simple Vector Store, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Simple Vector store.

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt is embedded and used for similarity search. The node returns the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents

Use insert documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Tool for AI Agent)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters

- **Table name**: Enter the name of the table you want to query.
- **Prompt**: Enter your search query.
- **Limit**: Enter a number to set how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Insert Documents parameters

- **Table name**: Enter the name of the table you want to query.

### Retrieve Documents parameters (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

- **Table name**: Enter the name of the table you want to query.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters

- **Name**: The name of the vector store.
- **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
- **Table Name**: Enter the PGVector table to use.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

A way to separate datasets in PGVector. This creates a separate table and column to keep track of which collection a vector belongs to.

- **Use Collection**: Select whether to use a collection (turned on) or not (turned off).
- **Collection Name**: Enter the name of the collection you want to use.
- **Collection Table Name**: Enter the name of the table to store collection information in.

The following options specify the names of the columns to store the vectors and corresponding information in:

- **ID Column Name**
- **Vector Column Name**
- **Content Column Name**
- **Metadata Column Name**

Available in **Get Many** mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document.

This is an `AND` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.

When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.

## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
1. Select the service you want to connect to.
1. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

1. Open the Trello board that contains the list.
1. If the list doesn't have any cards, add a card to the list.
1. Open the card, add `.json` at the end of the URL, and press enter.
1. In the JSON file, you will see a field called `idList`.
1. Copy the contents of the `idList`field and paste it in the **\*List ID** field in n8n.

## Simple Memory node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#simple-memory-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Single memory instance
- Managing the Session ID

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Simple Memory node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Single memory instance

If you add more than one Simple Memory node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](../../n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.

## Managing the Session ID

In most cases, the `sessionId` is automatically retrieved from the **On Chat Message** trigger. But you may run into an error with the phrase `No sessionId`.

If you have this error, first check the output of your Chat trigger to ensure it includes a `sessionId`.

If you're not using the **On Chat Message** trigger, you'll need to manage sessions manually.

For testing purposes, you can use a static key like `my_test_session`. If you use this approach, be sure to set up proper session management before activating the workflow to avoid potential issues in a live environment.

## 1. Getting data from the data warehouse

**URL:** llms-txt#1.-getting-data-from-the-data-warehouse

**Contents:**
- Create new workflow
- Add an HTTP Request node
- Get the data
- What's next?

In this part of the workflow, you will learn how to get data by making HTTP requests with the [**HTTP Request**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.

After completing this section, your workflow will look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.1.json)

First, let's set the scene for building Nathan's workflow.

## Create new workflow

Open your Editor UI and create a new workflow with one of the two possible commands:

- Select `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`N` or `Cmd`+`Option`+`N` on your keyboard.
- Open the left menu, navigate to **Workflows**, and select **Add workflow**.

Name this new workflow "Nathan's workflow."

The first thing you need to do is get data from ABCorp's old data warehouse.

In a previous chapter, you used an action node designed for a specific service (Hacker News). But not all apps or services have dedicated nodes, like the legacy data warehouse from Nathan's company.

Though we can't directly export the data, Nathan told us that the data warehouse has a couple of API endpoints. That's all we need to access the data using the [HTTP Request](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node in n8n.

No node for that service?

The HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes, allowing you to make HTTP requests to query data from apps and services. You can use it to access data from apps or services that don't have a dedicated node in n8n.

## Add an HTTP Request node

Now, in your Editor UI, add an HTTP Request node like you learned in the lesson [Adding nodes](../../chapter-1/#adding-nodes). The node window will open, where you need to configure some parameters.

This node will use credentials.

[Credentials](../../../../glossary/#credential-n8n) are unique pieces of information that identify a user or a service and allow them to access apps or services (in our case, represented as n8n nodes). A common form of credentials is a username and a password, but they can take other forms depending on the service.

In this case, you'll need the credentials for the ABCorp data warehouse API included in the email from n8n you received when you signed up for this course. If you haven't signed up yet, [sign up here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/PDEMrevI).

In the **Parameters** of the HTTP Request node, make the following adjustments:

- **Method**: This should default to GET. Make sure it's set to GET.
- **URL**: Add the **Dataset URL** you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
- **Send Headers**: Toggle this control to true. In **Specify Headers**, ensure **Using Fields Below** is selected.
  - **Header Parameters** > **Name**: Enter `unique_id`.
  - **Header Parameters** > **Value**: The Unique ID you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
- **Authentication**: Select **Generic Credential Type**. This option requires credentials before allowing you to access the data.
  - **Generic Auth Type**: Select **Header Auth**. (This field will appear after you select the Generic Credential Type for the Authentication.)

- **Credential for Header Auth**: To add your credentials, select **+ Create new credential**. This will open the Credentials window.

- In the Credentials window, set **Name** to be the **Header Auth name** you received in the email when you signed up for this course.

- In the Credentials window, set **Value** to be the **Header Auth value** you received in the email when you signed up for this course.

- Select the **Save** button in the Credentials window to save your credentials. Your **Credentials Connection** window should look like this:

*HTTP Request node credentials*

New credential names follow the " account" format by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app/service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials.

Once you save, exit out of the Credentials window to return to the HTTP Request node.

Select the **Execute step** button in the HTTP Request node window. The table view of the HTTP request results should look like this:

*HTTP Request node output*

This view should be familiar to you from the [Building a mini-workflow](../../chapter-2/) page.

This is the data from ABCorp's data warehouse that Nathan needs to work with. This data set includes sales information from 30 customers with five columns:

- `orderID`: The unique id of each order.
- `customerID`: The unique id of each customer.
- `employeeName`: The name of Nathan's colleague responsible for the customer.
- `orderPrice`: The total price of the customer's order.
- `orderStatus`: Whether the customer's order status is `booked` or still in `processing`.

**Nathan 🙋**: This is great! You already automated an important part of my job with only one node. Now instead of manually accessing the data every time I need it, I can use the HTTP Request Node to automatically get the information.

**You 👩‍🔧**: Exactly! In the next step, I'll help you one step further and insert the data you retrieved into Airtable.

## n8n Form Trigger node

**URL:** llms-txt#n8n-form-trigger-node

**Contents:**
- Build and test workflows
- Production workflows
- Set default selections with query parameters
- Node parameters
  - Authentication
  - Form URLs
  - Form Path
  - Form Title
  - Form Description
  - Form Elements

Use the n8n Form trigger to start a workflow when a user submits a form, taking the input data from the form. The node generates the form web page for you to use.

You can add more pages to continue the form with the [n8n Form](../n8n-nodes-base.form/) node.

## Build and test workflows

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL**. Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging.

There are two ways to test:

- Select **Execute Step**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node, but not the rest of the workflow.
- Select **Execute Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.

## Production workflows

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the **Production URL**. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form.

When working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.

## Set default selections with query parameters

You can set the initial values for fields by using [query parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Web_forms) with the initial URL provided by the n8n Form Trigger. Every [page in the form](../n8n-nodes-base.form/) receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger URL.

Query parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode.

When using query parameters, [percent-encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like [URL Encode/Decode](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/) to format your query parameters using percent-encoding.

As an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties:

- Production URL: `https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form`
- Fields:
  - `name`: `Jane Doe`
  - `email`: `jane.doe@example.com`

With query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above:

Here, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (`@`) with the string `%40` and the space character () with the string `%20`. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on.

These are the main node configuration fields:

- **Basic Auth**
- **None**

#### Using basic auth

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting.
- The **Password** that goes with that username.

The Form Trigger node has two URLs: **Test URL** and **Production URL**. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel. Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.

- **Test URL**: n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Execute Step** or **Execute Workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
- **Production URL**: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution. Select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.

Set a custom slug for the form.

Enter the title for your form. n8n displays the **Form Title** as the webpage title and main `h1` title on the form.

Enter the description for your form. n8n displays the **Form Description** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break.

Create the question fields for your form. Select **Add Form Element** to add a new field.

Every field has the following settings:

- **Field Label**: Enter the label that appears above the input field.
- **Element Type**: Choose from **Checkboxes**, **Custom HTML**, **Date**, **Dropdown**, **Email**, **File**, **Hidden Field**, **Number**, **Password**, **Radio Buttons**, **Text**, or **Textarea**.
  - Select **Checkboxes** to include checkbox elements in the form. By default, there is no limit on how many checboxes a form user can select. You can set the limit by specifying a value for the **Limit Selection** option as **Exact Number**, **Range**, or **Unlimited**.
  - Select **Custom HTML** to insert arbitrary HTML.
    - You can include elements like links, images, video, and more. You can't include `<script>`, `<style>`, or `<input>` elements.
    - By default, Custom HTML fields aren't included in the node output. To include the Custom HTML content in the output, fill out the associated **Element Name** field.
  - Select **Date** to include a date picker in the form. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](../../../../code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information on formatting dates.
  - Select **Dropdown List** > **Add Field Option** to add multiple options. By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, turn on **Multiple Choice**.
  - Select **Radio Buttons** to include radio button elements in the form.
  - Select **Hidden Field** to include a form element without displaying it on the form. You can set a default value using the **Field Value** parameter or pass values for the field using [query parameters](#set-default-selections-with-query-parameters).
- **Required Field**: Turn on to require users to complete this field on the form.

Choose when n8n sends a response to the form submission. You can respond when:

- **Form Is Submitted**: Send a response to the user as soon as they submit the form.
- **Workflow Finishes**: Use this if you want the workflow to complete its execution before you send a response to the user. If the workflow errors, it sends a response to the user telling them there was a problem submitting the form.

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options:

- **Append n8n Attribution**: Turn off to hide the **Form automated with n8n** attribute at the bottom of the form.
- **Button Label**: The label to use for your form's submit button. n8n displays the **Button Label** as the name of the submit button.
- **Form Path**: The final segment of the form's URL, for both testing and production. Replaces the automatically generated UUID as the final component.
- **Ignore Bots**: Turn on to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers.
- **Use Workflow Timezone**: Turn on to use the timezone in the [Workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/) instead of UTC (default). This affects the value of the `submittedAt` timestamp in the node output.
- **Custom Form Styling**: Override the default styling of the public form interface with CSS. The field pre-populates with the default styling so you can change only what you need to.

## Customizing Form Trigger node behavior

### Format response text with line breaks

You can use one of the following methods to add line breaks to form response text:

• Use HTML formatting instead of plain text in the formSubmittedText field • Replace newline characters (`\n`) with HTML break tags (`<br>`) before sending the response • Consider using a custom HTML response page if you need more formatting control

### Restrict form access with authentication

You can use one of the following options to add authentication to your form:

• Use the OTP (One-Time Password) field with TOTP node validation for token-based authentication • Add a Wait node with form authentication as a secondary form page • Store hashed passwords in a database and compare against form submissions for validation • Use external authentication providers like Google Forms if you need advanced authentication

## Node codex files

**URL:** llms-txt#node-codex-files

**Contents:**
- Node categories

The codex file contains metadata about your node. This file is the JSON file at the root of your node. For example, the [`HttpBin.node.json`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/nodes/HttpBin/HttpBin.node.json) file in the n8n starter.

The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named `MyNode.node.ts`, the codex would be named `MyNode.node.json`.

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `node`         | Includes the node name. Must start with `n8n-nodes-base.`. For example, `n8n-nodes-base.openweatherapi`.                                                        |
| `nodeVersion`  | The node version. This should have the same value as the `version` parameter in your main node file. For example, `"1.0"`.                                      |
| `codexVersion` | The codex file version. The current version is `"1.0"`.                                                                                                         |
| `categories`   | The settings in the `categories` array determine which category n8n adds your node to in the GUI. See [Node categories](#node-categories) for more information. |
| `resources`    | The `resources` object contains links to your node documentation. n8n automatically adds help links to credentials and nodes in the GUI.                        |

You can define one or more categories in your node configuration JSON. This helps n8n put the node in the correct category in the nodes panel.

Choose from these categories:

- Data & Storage
- Finance & Accounting
- Marketing & Content
- Productivity
- Miscellaneous
- Sales
- Development
- Analytics
- Communication
- Utility

You must match the syntax. For example, `Data & Storage` not `data and storage`.

## Wolfram|Alpha tool node

**URL:** llms-txt#wolfram|alpha-tool-node

**Contents:**
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

Use the Wolfram|Alpha tool node to connect your [agents](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) and [chains](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain) to Wolfram|Alpha's computational intelligence engine.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/wolframalpha/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Workflow development

**URL:** llms-txt#workflow-development

**Contents:**
- Build and test workflows
- Production workflows

The [Webhook node](../) works a bit differently from other core nodes. n8n recommends following these processes for building, testing, and using your Webhook node in production.

n8n generates two **Webhook URLs** for each Webhook node: a **Test URL** and a **Production URL**.

## Build and test workflows

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test** webhook URL.

Using a test webhook ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. Select **Listen for test event** to register the webhook before sending the data to the test webhook. The test webhook stays active for 120 seconds.

When using the Webhook node on localhost on a [self-hosted](../../../../../hosting/) n8n instance, run n8n in tunnel mode:

- [npm with tunnel](../../../../../hosting/installation/npm/#n8n-with-tunnel)
- [Docker with tunnel](../../../../../hosting/installation/docker/#n8n-with-tunnel)

[](/_video/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/webhook/webhook-node-intro.mp4)

## Production workflows

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the **Production** webhook URL. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when an external service calls the webhook URL.

When working with a Production webhook, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the webhook isn't visible in the editor UI with the production webhook.

Refer to [Create a workflow](../../../../../workflows/create/) for more information on activating workflows.

Use the Character Text Splitter node to split document data based on characters.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Character Text Splitter node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Separator**: Select the separator used to split the document into separate items.
- **Chunk Size**: Enter the number of characters in each chunk.

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Mode
  - Fields to Set
  - Keep Only Set Fields
  - Include in Output
- Node options
  - Include Binary Data
  - Ignore Type Conversion Errors
  - Support Dot Notation
- Templates and examples

Use the Edit Fields node to set workflow data. This node can set new data as well as overwrite data that already exists. This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values to Google Sheets or databases.

These are the settings and options available in the Edit Fields node.

You can either use **Manual Mapping** to edit fields using the GUI or **JSON Output** to write JSON that n8n adds to the input data.

If you select **Mode** > **Manual Mapping**, you can configure the fields by dragging and dropping values from **INPUT**.

The default behavior when you drag a value is:

- n8n sets the value's name as the field name.
- The field value contains an expression which accesses the value.

If you don't want to use expressions:

1. Hover over a field. n8n displays the **Fixed | Expressions** toggle.
1. Select **Fixed**.

You can do this for both the name and value of the field.

### Keep Only Set Fields

Enable this to discard any input data that you don't use in **Fields to Set**.

### Include in Output

Choose which input data to include in the node's output data.

Use these options to customize the behavior of the node.

### Include Binary Data

If the input data includes binary data, choose whether to include it in the Edit Fields node's output data.

### Ignore Type Conversion Errors

Enabling this allows n8n to ignore some data type errors when mapping fields.

### Support Dot Notation

By default, n8n supports dot notation.

For example, when using manual mapping, the node follows the dot notation for the **Name** field. That means if you set the name in the **Name** field as `number.one` and the value in the **Value** field as `20`, the resulting JSON is:

You can prevent this behavior by selecting **Add Option** > **Support Dot Notation**, and setting the **Dot Notion** field to off. Now the resulting JSON is:

The Vector Store Question Answer node is a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) that allows an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to summarize results and answer questions based on chunks from a [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Vector Store Question Answer node, and links to more resources.

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Vector Store Question Answer Tool integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/vector-store-tool/) page.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

### Description of Data

Enter a description of the data in the vector store.

The maximum number of results to return.

## How n8n populates the tool description

n8n uses the node name (select the name to edit) and **Description of Data** parameter to populate the tool description for AI agents using the following format:

> Useful for when you need to answer questions about [node name]. Whenever you need information about [Description of Data], you should ALWAYS use this. Input should be a fully formed question.

Spaces in the node name are converted to underscores in the tool description.

Avoid special characters in node names

Using special characters in the node name will cause errors when the agent runs:

Use only alphanumeric characters, spaces, dashes, and underscores in node names.

## Redis Vector Store node

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites

  - Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents
  - Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool
  - Use a retriever to fetch documents
  - Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions
- Node parameters
  - Operation Mode
  - Rerank Results
  - Get Many parameters

Use the Redis Vector Store node to interact with your Redis database as a [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store). You can insert documents into the vector database, get documents from the vector database, retrieve documents using a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain), or connect it directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to use as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Redis Vector Store node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/redis/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

Before using this node, you need a Redis database with the [Redis Query Engine](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/ai/search-and-query/?utm_source=n8n&utm_medium=docs) enabled. Use one of the following:

- Redis Open Source (v8.0 and later) - includes the Redis Query Engine by default
- [Redis Cloud](https://cloud.redis.io/?utm_source=n8n&utm_medium=docs) - fully managed service
- [Redis Software](https://redis.io/software/?utm_source=n8n&utm_medium=docs) - self-managed deployment

A new index will be created if you don't have one.

Creating your own indices in advance is only necessary if you want to use a custom index schema or reuse an existing index. Otherwise, you can skip this step and let the node create a new index for you based on the options you specify.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the Redis Vector Store node in the following patterns:

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents

You can use the Redis Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Redis Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (the template uses the Supabase Vector Store, but the pattern is the same).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the Redis Vector Store node directly to the [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Redis Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Redis Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Redis Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Redis Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Redis Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Redis Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2464-scale-deal-flow-with-a-pitch-deck-ai-vision-chatbot-and-qdrant-vector-store/) (the linked example uses Qdrant, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Redis Vector store.

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt is embedded and used for similarity search. The node returns the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents

Use insert documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Tool for AI Agent)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters

- **Redis Index**: Enter the name of the Redis vector search index to use. Optionally choose an existing one from the list.
- **Prompt**: Enter the search query.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

This Operation Mode includes one **Node option**, the [Metadata Filter](#metadata-filter).

### Insert Documents parameters

- **Redis Index**: Enter the name of the Redis vector search index to use. Optionally choose an existing one from the list.

### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters

- **Redis Index**: Enter the name of the Redis vector search index to use.

This Operation Mode includes one **Node option**, the [Metadata Filter](#metadata-filter). Optionally choose an existing one from the list.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters

- **Name**: The name of the vector store.
- **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
- **Redis Index**: Enter the name of the Redis vector search index to use. Optionally choose an existing one from the list.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

Whether to include document metadata.

You can use this with the [Get Many](#get-many-parameters) and [Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)](#retrieve-documents-as-tool-for-ai-agent-parameters) modes.

Metadata filters are available for the [Get Many](#get-many-parameters), [Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)](#retrieve-documents-as-vector-store-for-chaintool-parameters), and [Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)](#retrieve-documents-as-tool-for-ai-agent-parameters) operation modes. This is an `OR` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, at least one of them must match. When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.

### Redis Configuration Options

Available for all operation modes:

- **Metadata Key**: Enter the key for the metadata field in the Redis hash (default: `metadata`).
- **Key Prefix**: Enter the key prefix for storing documents (default: `doc:`).
- **Content Key**: Enter the key for the content field in the Redis hash (default: `content`).
- **Embedding Key**: Enter the key for the embedding field in the Redis hash (default: `embedding`).

Available for the [Insert Documents](#insert-documents-parameters) operation mode:

- **Overwrite Documents**: Select whether to overwrite existing documents (turned on) or not (turned off). Also deletes the index.
- **Time-to-Live**: Enter the time-to-live for documents in seconds. Does not expire the index.

## Queue mode

**URL:** llms-txt#queue-mode

**Contents:**
- How it works
- Configuring workers
  - Set encryption key
  - Set executions mode
  - Start Redis
  - Start workers
- Running n8n with queues
- Webhook processors
  - Configure webhook URL
  - Configure load balancer

You can run n8n in different modes depending on your needs. The queue mode provides the best scalability.

n8n doesn't support queue mode with binary data storage in filesystem. If your workflows need to persist binary data in queue mode, you can use [S3 external storage](../external-storage/).

When running in queue mode, you have multiple n8n instances set up, with one main instance receiving workflow information (such as triggers) and the worker instances performing the executions.

Each worker is its own Node.js instance, running in `main` mode, but able to handle multiple simultaneous workflow executions due to their high IOPS (input-output operations per second).

By using worker instances and running in queue mode, you can scale n8n up (by adding workers) and down (by removing workers) as needed to handle the workload.

This is the process flow:

1. The main n8n instance handles timers and webhook calls, generating (but not running) a workflow execution.
1. It passes the execution ID to a message broker, [Redis](#start-redis), which maintains the queue of pending executions and allows the next available worker to pick them up.
1. A worker in the pool picks up message from Redis.
1. The worker uses the execution ID to get workflow information from the database.
1. After completing the workflow execution, the worker:
   - Writes the results to the database.
   - Posts to Redis, saying that the execution has finished.
1. Redis notifies the main instance.

## Configuring workers

Workers are n8n instances that do the actual work. They receive information from the main n8n process about the workflows that have to get executed, execute the workflows, and update the status after each execution is complete.

### Set encryption key

n8n automatically generates an encryption key upon first startup. You can also provide your own custom key using [environment variable](../../configuration/environment-variables/) if desired.

The encryption key of the main n8n instance must be shared with all worker and webhooks processor nodes to ensure these worker nodes are able to access credentials stored in the database.

Set the encryption key for each worker node in a [configuration file](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) or by setting the corresponding environment variable:

### Set executions mode

Database considerations

n8n recommends using Postgres 13+. Running n8n with execution mode set to `queue` with an SQLite database isn't recommended.

Set the environment variable `EXECUTIONS_MODE` to `queue` on the main instance and any workers using the following command.

Alternatively, you can set `executions.mode` to `queue` in the [configuration file](../../configuration/environment-variables/).

Running Redis on a separate machine

You can run Redis on a separate machine, just make sure that it's accessible by the n8n instance.

To run Redis in a Docker container, follow the instructions below:

Run the following command to start a Redis instance:

By default, Redis runs on `localhost` on port `6379` with no password. Based on your Redis configuration, set the following configurations for the main n8n process. These will allow n8n to interact with Redis.

| Using configuration file          | Using environment variables       | Description                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `queue.bull.redis.host:localhost` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_HOST=localhost` | By default, Redis runs on `localhost`.                                                    |
| `queue.bull.redis.port:6379`      | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PORT=6379`      | The default port is `6379`. If Redis is running on a different port, configure the value. |

You can also set the following optional configurations:

| Using configuration file                    | Using environment variables          | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `queue.bull.redis.username:USERNAME`        | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_USERNAME`          | By default, Redis doesn't require a username. If you're using a specific user, configure it variable.                               |
| `queue.bull.redis.password:PASSWORD`        | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PASSWORD`          | By default, Redis doesn't require a password. If you're using a password, configure it variable.                                    |
| `queue.bull.redis.db:0`                     | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_DB`                | The default value is `0`. If you change this value, update the configuration.                                                       |
| `queue.bull.redis.timeoutThreshold:10000ms` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD` | Tells n8n how long it should wait if Redis is unavailable before exiting. The default value is `10000` (ms).                        |
| `queue.bull.gracefulShutdownTimeout:30`     | `N8N_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`      | A graceful shutdown timeout for workers to finish executing jobs before terminating the process. The default value is `30` seconds. |

Now you can start your n8n instance and it will connect to your Redis instance.

You will need to start worker processes to allow n8n to execute workflows. If you want to host workers on a separate machine, install n8n on the machine and make sure that it's connected to your Redis instance and the n8n database.

Start worker processes by running the following command from the root directory:

If you're using Docker, use the following command:

You can set up multiple worker processes. Make sure that all the worker processes have access to Redis and the n8n database.

Each worker process runs a server that exposes optional endpoints:

- `/healthz`: returns whether the worker is up, if you enable the `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE` environment variable
- `/healthz/readiness`: returns whether worker's DB and Redis connections are ready, if you enable the `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE` environment variable
- [credentials overwrite endpoint](../../../embed/configuration/#credential-overwrites)
- [`/metrics`](../../configuration/configuration-examples/prometheus/)

#### View running workers

- Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans.
- If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa).

You can view running workers and their performance metrics in n8n by selecting **Settings** > **Workers**.

## Running n8n with queues

When running n8n with queues, all the production workflow executions get processed by worker processes. This means that even the webhook calls get delegated to the worker processes, which might add some overhead and extra latency.

Redis acts as the message broker, and the database persists data, so access to both is required. Running a distributed system with this setup over SQLite isn't supported.

If you want to migrate data from one database to another, you can use the Export and Import commands. Refer to the [CLI commands for n8n](../../cli-commands/#export-workflows-and-credentials) documentation to learn how to use these commands.

## Webhook processors

Webhook processes rely on Redis and need the `EXECUTIONS_MODE` environment variable set too. Follow the [configure the workers](#configuring-workers) section above to setup webhook processor nodes.

Webhook processors are another layer of scaling in n8n. Configuring the webhook processor is optional, and allows you to scale the incoming webhook requests.

This method allows n8n to process a huge number of parallel requests. All you have to do is add more webhook processes and workers accordingly. The webhook process will listen to requests on the same port (default: `5678`). Run these processes in containers or separate machines, and have a load balancing system to route requests accordingly.

n8n doesn't recommend adding the main process to the load balancer pool. If you add the main process to the pool, it will receive requests and possibly a heavy load. This will result in degraded performance for editing, viewing, and interacting with the n8n UI.

You can start the webhook processor by executing the following command from the root directory:

If you're using Docker, use the following command:

### Configure webhook URL

To configure your webhook URL, execute the following command on the machine running the main n8n instance:

You can also set this value in the configuration file.

### Configure load balancer

When using multiple webhook processes you will need a load balancer to route requests. If you are using the same domain name for your n8n instance and the webhooks, you can set up your load balancer to route requests as follows:

- Redirect any request that matches `/webhook/*` to the webhook servers pool
- All other paths (the n8n internal API, the static files for the editor, etc.) should get routed to the main process

**Note:** The default URL for manual workflow executions is `/webhook-test/*`. Make sure that these URLs route to your main process.

You can change this path in the configuration file `endpoints.webhook` or using the `N8N_ENDPOINT_WEBHOOK` environment variable. If you change these, update your load balancer accordingly.

### Disable webhook processing in the main process (optional)

You have webhook processors to execute the workflows. You can disable the webhook processing in the main process. This will make sure to execute all webhook executions in the webhook processors. In the configuration file set `endpoints.disableProductionWebhooksOnMainProcess` to `true` so that n8n doesn't process webhook requests on the main process.

Alternatively, you can use the following command:

When disabling the webhook process in the main process, run the main process and don't add it to the load balancer's webhook pool.

## Configure worker concurrency

You can define the number of jobs a worker can run in parallel by using the `concurrency` flag. It defaults to `10`. To change it:

## Concurrency and scaling recommendations

n8n recommends setting concurrency to 5 or higher for your worker instances. Setting low concurrency values with a large numbers of workers can exhaust your database's connection pool, leading to processing delays and failures.

- Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans.

In queue mode you can run more than one `main` process for high availability.

In a single-mode setup, the `main` process does two sets of tasks:

- **regular tasks**, such as running the API, serving the UI, and listening for webhooks, and
- **at-most-once tasks**, such as running non-HTTP triggers (timers, pollers, and persistent connections like RabbitMQ and IMAP), and pruning executions and binary data.

In a multi-main setup, there are two kinds of `main` processes:

- **followers**, which run **regular tasks**, and
- the **leader**, which runs **both regular and at-most-once tasks**.

### Leader designation

In a multi-main setup, all main instances handle the leadership process transparently to users. In case the current leader becomes unavailable, for example because it crashed or its event loop became too busy, other followers can take over. If the previous leader becomes responsive again, it becomes a follower.

### Configuring multi-main setup

To deploy n8n in multi-main setup, ensure:

- All `main` processes are running in queue mode and are connected to Postgres and Redis.
- All `main` and `worker` processes are running the same version of n8n.
- All `main` processes have set the environment variable `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_ENABLED` to `true`.
- All `main` processes are running behind a load balancer with session persistence (sticky sessions) enabled.

If needed, you can adjust the leader key options:

| Using configuration file    | Using environment variables             | Description                                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `multiMainSetup.ttl:10`     | `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_KEY_TTL=10`       | Time to live (in seconds) for leader key in multi-main setup. |
| `multiMainSetup.interval:3` | `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_CHECK_INTERVAL=3` | Interval (in seconds) for leader check in multi-main setup.   |

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
export N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<main_instance_encryption_key>
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
export EXECUTIONS_MODE=queue
```

## Workflow 3: Monitoring workflow errors

**URL:** llms-txt#workflow-3:-monitoring-workflow-errors

Last but not least, let's help Nathan know if there are any errors running the workflow.

To accomplish this task, create an Error workflow that monitors the main workflow:

1. Create a new workflow.

1. Add an **Error Trigger node** (and execute it as a test).

1. Connect a **Discord node** to the **Error Trigger node** and configure these fields:

- **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL that you received in the email from n8n when you signed up for this course.

- **Text**: "The workflow `{workflow name}` failed, with the error message: `{execution error message}`. Last node executed: `{name of the last executed node}`. Check this workflow execution here: `{execution URL}` My Unique ID: " followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.

Note that you need to replace the text in curly brackets `{}` with expressions that take the respective information from the Error Trigger node.

1. Execute the Discord node.

1. Set the newly created workflow as the **Error Workflow** for the main workflow you created in the previous lesson.

The workflow should look like this:

*Workflow 3 for monitoring workflow errors*

- What fields does the **Error Trigger node** return?
- What information about the execution does the **Error Trigger node** return?
- What information about the workflow does the **Error Trigger node** return?
- What's the expression to reference the workflow name?

- An **API Key**: To view or generate an API key, go to **Integrations and API > API**. Refer to the [GetResponse Help Center](https://www.getresponse.com/help/where-do-i-find-the-api-key.html) for more detailed instructions.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Client ID**: Generated when you [register your application](https://apidocs.getresponse.com/v3/authentication/oauth2).
- A **Client Secret**: Generated when you [register your application](https://apidocs.getresponse.com/v3/authentication/oauth2) as the **Client Secret Key**.

When you register your application, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from n8n and add it as the **Redirect URL** in GetResponse.

Redirect URL with localhost

The Redirect URL should be a URL in your domain, for example: `https://mytemplatemaker.example.com/gr_callback`. GetResponse doesn't accept a localhost callback URL. Refer to the [FAQs](#configure-oauth2-credentials-for-a-local-environment) to configure the credentials for the local environment.

## Configure OAuth2 credentials for a local environment

GetResponse doesn't accept the localhost callback URL. Follow the steps below to configure the OAuth credentials for a local environment:

1. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose the local server running on port `5678` to the internet. In your terminal, run the following command:

2. Run the following command in a new terminal. Replace `<YOUR-NGROK-URL>` with the URL that you got from the previous step.

3. Follow the [Using OAuth2](#using-oauth2) instructions to configure your credentials, using this URL as your **Redirect URL**.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
ngrok http 5678
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
export WEBHOOK_URL=<YOUR-NGROK-URL>
```

## Schedule Trigger node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#schedule-trigger-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Invalid cron expression
- Scheduled workflows run at the wrong time
  - Adjust the timezone globally
  - Adjust the timezone for an individual workflow
  - Variables not working as expected
  - Changing the trigger interval

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Schedule Trigger node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Invalid cron expression

This error occurs when you set **Trigger Interval** to **Custom (Cron)** and n8n doesn't understand your cron expression. This may mean that there is a mistake in your cron expression or that you're using an incompatible syntax.

To debug, check that the following:

- That your cron expression follows the syntax used in the [cron examples](../#custom-cron-interval)
- That your cron expression (after removing the [seconds column](../#why-there-are-six-asterisks-in-the-cron-expression)) validates on [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/)

## Scheduled workflows run at the wrong time

If the Schedule Trigger node runs at the wrong time, it may mean that you need to adjust the time zone n8n uses.

### Adjust the timezone globally

If you're using [n8n Cloud](../../../../../manage-cloud/overview/), follow the instructions on the [set the Cloud instance timezone](../../../../../manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/) page to ensure that n8n executes in sync with your local time.

If you're [self hosting](../../../../../hosting/), set your global timezone using the [`GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable](../../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/).

### Adjust the timezone for an individual workflow

To set the timezone for an individual workflow:

1. Open the workflow on the canvas.
1. Select the **Three dots icon** in the upper-right corner.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Change the **Timezone** setting.
1. Select **Save**.

### Variables not working as expected

While variables can be used in the scheduled trigger, their values only get evaluated when the workflow is activated. After activating the worfklow, you can alter a variable's value in the settings but it won't change how often the workflow runs. To work around this, you must stop and then re-activate the workflow to apply the updated variable value.

### Changing the trigger interval

You can update the scheduled trigger interval at any time but it only gets updated when the workflow is activated. If you change the trigger interval after the workflow is active, the changes won't take effect until you stop and then re-activate the workflow.

Also, the schedule begins from the time when you activate the workflow. For example, if you had originally set a schedule of every 1 hour and it should execute at 12:00, if you changed it to a 2 hour schedule and re-activated the workflow at 11:30, the next execution will be at 13:30, 2 hours from when you activated it.

## Design your node's user interface

**URL:** llms-txt#design-your-node's-user-interface

**Contents:**
- Design guidance
- Standards
  - UI text style
  - UI text terminology
  - Node naming conventions
  - Showing and hiding fields
  - Conventions by field type
  - Common patterns and exceptions

Most nodes are a GUI (graphical user interface) representation of an API. Designing the interface means finding a user-friendly way to represent API endpoints and parameters. Directly translating an entire API into form fields in a node may not result in a good user experience.

This document provides design guidance and standards to follow. These guidelines are the same as those used by n8n. This helps provide a smooth and consistent user experience for users mixing community and built-in nodes.

All node's use n8n's [node UI elements](../../build/reference/ui-elements/), so you don't need to consider style details such as colors, borders, and so on. However, it's still useful to go through a basic design process:

- Review the documentation for the API you're integrating. Ask yourself:
  - What can you leave out?
  - What can you simplify?
  - Which parts of the API are confusing? How can you help users understand them?
- Use a wireframe tool to try out your field layout. If you find your node has a lot of fields and is getting confusing, consider n8n's guidance on [showing and hiding fields](#showing-and-hiding-fields).

| Element         | Style                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Drop-down value | Title case                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Hint            | Sentence case                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Info box        | Sentence case. Don't use a period (`.`) for one-sentence information. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab. |
| Node name       | Title case                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Parameter name  | Title case                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Subtitle        | Title case                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Tooltip         | Sentence case. Don't use a period (`.`) for one-sentence tooltips. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab.    |

### UI text terminology

- Use the same terminology as the service the node connects to. For example, a Notion node should refer to Notion blocks, not Notion paragraphs, because Notion calls these elements blocks. There are exceptions to this rule, usually to avoid technical terms (for example, refer to the guidance on [name and description for upsert operations](#upsert-operations)).
- Sometimes a service has different terms for something in its API and in its GUI. Use the GUI language in your node, as this is what most users are familiar with. If you think some users may need to refer to the service's API docs, consider including this information in a hint.
- Don't use technical jargon when there are simpler alternatives.
- Be consistent when naming things. For example, choose one of `directory` or `folder` then stick to it.

### Node naming conventions

| Convention                                                                                             | Correct         | Incorrect                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| If a node is a trigger node, the displayed name should have 'Trigger' at the end, with a space before. | Shopify Trigger | ShopifyTrigger, Shopify trigger |
| Don't include 'node' in the name.                                                                      | Asana           | Asana Node, Asana node          |

### Showing and hiding fields

Fields can either be:

- Displayed when the node opens: use this for resources and operations, and required fields.
- Hidden in the **Optional fields** section until a user clicks on that section: use this for optional fields.

Progressively disclose complexity: hide a field until any earlier fields it depends on have values. For example, if you have a **Filter by date** toggle, and a **Date to filter by** datepicker, don't display **Date to filter by** until the user enables **Filter by date**.

### Conventions by field type

n8n automatically displays credential fields as the top fields in the node.

#### Resources and operations

APIs usually involve doing something to data. For example, "get all tasks." In this example, "task" is the resource, and "get all" is the operation.

When your node has this resource and operation pattern, your first field should be **Resource**, and your second field should be **Operation**.

- Most important to least important.
- Scope: from broad to narrow. For example, you have fields for **Document**, **Page**, and **Text to insert**, put them in that order.

- Order fields alphabetically. To group similar things together, you can rename them. For example, rename **Email** and **Secondary Email** to **Email (primary)** and **Email (secondary)**.
- If an optional field has a default value that the node uses when the value isn't set, load the field with that value. Explain this in the field description. For example, **Defaults to false**.
- Connected fields: if one optional fields is dependent on another, bundle them together. They should both be under a single option that shows both fields when selected.
- If you have a lot of optional fields, consider grouping them by theme.

There are five types of help built in to the GUI:

- Info boxes: yellow boxes that appear between fields. Refer to [UI elements | Notice](../../build/reference/ui-elements/#notice) for more information.
- Use info boxes for essential information. Don't over-use them. By making them rare, they stand out more and grab the user's attention.
- Parameter hints: lines of text displayed beneath a user input field. Use this when there's something the user needs to know, but an info box would be excessive.
- Node hints: provide help in the input panel, output panel, or node details view. Refer to [UI elements | Hints](../../build/reference/ui-elements/#hints) for more information.
- Tooltips: callouts that appear when the user hovers over the tooltip icon . Use tooltips for extra information that the user might need.
- You don't have to provide a tooltip for every field. Only add one if it contains useful information.
- When writing tooltips, think about what the user needs. Don't just copy-paste API parameter descriptions. If the description doesn't make sense, or has errors, improve it.
- Placeholder text: n8n can display placeholder text in a field where the user hasn't entered a value. This can help the user know what's expected in that field.

Info boxes, hints, and tooltips can contain links to more information.

Make it clear which fields are required.

Add validation rules to fields if possible. For example, check for valid email patterns if the field expects an email.

When displaying errors, make sure only the main error message displays in the red error title. More information should go in **Details**.

Refer to [Node Error Handling](../../build/reference/error-handling/) for more information.

- Tooltips for binary states should start with something like **Whether to . . .** .
- You may need a list rather than a toggle:
  - Use toggles when it's clear what happens in a false state. For example, **Simplify Output?**. The alternative (don't simplify output) is clear.
  - Use a dropdown list with named options when you need more clarity. For example, **Append?**. What happens if you don't append is unclear (it could be that nothing happens, or information is overwritten, or discarded).

- Set default values for lists whenever possible. The default should be the most-used option.
- Sort list options alphabetically.
- You can include list option descriptions. Only add descriptions if they provide useful information.
- If there is an option like **All**, use the word **All**, not shorthand like **\***.

#### Trigger node inputs

When a trigger node has a parameter for specifying which events to trigger on:

- Name the parameter **Trigger on**.
- Don't include a tooltip.

Set subtitles based on the values of the main parameters. For example:

When performing an operation on a specific record, such as "update a task comment" you need a way to specify which record you want to change.

- Wherever possible, provide two ways to specify a record:
  - By choosing from a pre-populated list. You can generate this list using the `loadOptions` parameter. Refer to [Base files](../../build/reference/node-base-files/) for more information.
  - By entering an ID.
- Name the field `<Record name> name or ID`. For example, **Workspace Name or ID**. Add a tooltip saying "Choose a name from the list, or specify an ID using an expression." Link to n8n's [Expressions](../../../../code/expressions/) documentation.
- Build your node so that it can handle users providing more information than required. For example:
  - If you need a relative path, handle the user pasting in the absolute path.
  - If the user needs to get an ID from a URL, handle the user pasting in the entire URL.

#### Dates and timestamps

n8n uses [ISO timestamp strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for dates and times. Make sure that any date or timestamp field you add supports all ISO 8601 formats.

You should support two ways of specifying the content of a text input that expects JSON:

- Typing JSON directly into the text input: you need to parse the resulting string into a JSON object.
- Using an expression that returns JSON.

### Common patterns and exceptions

This section provides guidance on handling common design patterns, including some edge cases and exceptions to the main standards.

#### Simplify responses

APIs can return a lot of data that isn't useful. Consider adding a toggle that allows users to choose to simplify the response data:

- Name: **Simplify Response**
- Description: **Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data**

#### Upsert operations

This should always be a separate operation with:

- Name: **Create or Update**
- Description: **Create a new record, or update the current one if it already exists (upsert)**

#### Boolean operators

n8n doesn't have good support for combining boolean operators, such as AND and OR, in the GUI. Whenever possible, provide options for all ANDs or all ORs.

For example, you have a field called **Must match** to test if values match. Include options to test for **Any** and **All**, as separate options.

#### Source keys or binary properties

Binary data is file data, such as spreadsheets or images. In n8n, you need a named key to reference the data. Don't use the terms "binary data" or "binary property" for this field. Instead, use a more descriptive name: **Input data field name** / **Output data field name**.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
subtitle: '={{$parameter["operation"] + ": " + $parameter["resource"]}}',
```

The SQL Agent uses a SQL database as a data source. It can understand natural language questions, convert them into SQL queries, execute the queries, and present the results in a user-friendly format. This agent is valuable for building natural language interfaces to databases.

Refer to [AI Agent](../) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

Configure the SQL Agent using the following parameters.

Choose the database to use as a data source for the node. Options include:

- **MySQL**: Select this option to use a MySQL database.
  - Also select the **Credential for MySQL**.
- **SQLite**: Select this option to use a SQLite database.
  - You must add a [Read/Write File From Disk](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) node before the Agent to read your SQLite file.
  - Also enter the **Input Binary Field** name of your SQLite file coming from the Read/Write File From Disk node.
- **Postgres**: Select this option to use a Postgres database.
  - Also select the **Credential for Postgres**.

Postgres and MySQL Agents

If you are using [Postgres](../../../../credentials/postgres/) or [MySQL](../../../../credentials/mysql/), this agent doesn't support the credential tunnel options.

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

- **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
- **Define below**: If you select this option, provide either static text or an expression for dynamic content to serve as the prompt in the **Prompt (User Message)** field.

Refine the SQL Agent node's behavior using these options:

If you'd like the node to ignore any tables from the database, enter a comma-separated list of tables you'd like it to ignore.

If left empty, the agent doesn't ignore any tables.

### Include Sample Rows

Enter the number of sample rows to include in the prompt to the agent. Default is `3`.

Sample rows help the agent understand the schema of the database, but they also increase the number of tokens used.

If you'd only like to include specific tables from the database, enter a comma-separated list of tables to include.

If left empty, the agent includes all tables.

Enter a message you'd like to send to the agent before the **Prompt** text. This initial message can provide more context and guidance to the agent about what it can and can't do, and how to format the response.

n8n fills this field with an example.

Enter a message you'd like to send to the agent after the **Prompt** text.

Available LangChain expressions:

- `{chatHistory}`: A history of messages in this conversation, useful for maintaining context.
- `{input}`: Contains the user prompt.
- `{agent_scratchpad}`: Information to remember for the next iteration.

n8n fills this field with an example.

Enter the maximum number of results to return.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Chunk Size**: Enter the number of characters in each chunk.
- **Chunk Overlap**: Enter how much overlap to have between chunks.

## Automating a business workflow

**URL:** llms-txt#automating-a-business-workflow

**Contents:**
- Workflow design
- Workflow prerequisites

Remember [our friend Nathan](../../../level-one/chapter-3/)?

**Nathan 🙋:** Hello, it's me again. My manager was so impressed with my first workflow automation solution that she entrusted me with more responsibility.\
**You 👩‍🔧:** More work and responsibility. Congratulations, I guess. What do you need to do now?\
**Nathan 🙋:** I got access to all our sales data and I'm now responsible for creating two reports: one for regional sales and one for orders prices. They're based on data from different sources and come in different formats.\
**You 👩‍🔧:** Sounds like a lot of manual work, but the kind that can be automated. Let's do it!

Now that we know what Nathan wants to automate, let's list the steps he needs to take to achieve this:

1. Get and combine data from all necessary sources.
1. Sort the data and format the dates.
1. Write binary files.
1. Send notifications using email and Discord.

n8n provides [core nodes](../../../../integrations/builtin/node-types/#core-nodes) for all these steps. This use case is somewhat complex. We should build it from three separate workflows:

1. A workflow that merges the company data with external information.
1. A workflow that generates the reports.
1. A workflow that monitors errors in the second workflow.

## Workflow prerequisites

To build the workflows, you will need the following:

- An [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) account and [credentials](../../../../integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/).
- A [Google](https://www.google.com/account/about/) account and [credentials](../../../../integrations/builtin/credentials/google/) to access Gmail.
- A [Discord](https://discord.com/) account and webhook URL (you receive this using email when you sign up for this course).

Next, you will build these three workflows with step-by-step instructions.

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the Weaviate Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents

You can use the Weaviate Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Weaviate Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the Weaviate Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Weaviate Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Weaviate Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Weaviate Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Weaviate Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Weaviate Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

You can separate your data into isolated tenants for the same collection (for example, for different customers). For that, you must always provide a [Tenant Name](#tenant-name) both when inserting and retrieving objects. [Read more about multi tenancy in Weaviate docs](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/manage-collections/multi-tenancy).

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt is embedded and used for similarity search. The node returns the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents

Use insert documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Tool for AI Agent)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

### Get Many parameters

- **Weaviate Collection**: Enter the name of the Weaviate collection to use.
- **Prompt**: Enter the search query.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Insert Documents parameters

- **Weaviate Collection**: Enter the name of the Weaviate collection to use.
- **Embedding Batch Size**: The number of documents to embed in a single batch. The default is 200 documents.

### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters

- **Weaviate Collection**: Enter the name of the Weaviate collection to use.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters

- **Weaviate Collection**: The name of the vector store.
- **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
- **Weaviate Collection**: Enter the name of the Weaviate collection to use.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

Available for the [Get Many](#get-many), [Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)](#retrieve-documents-as-vector-store-for-chaintool), and [Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)](#retrieve-documents-as-tool-for-ai-agent) operation modes.

When searching for data, use this to match metadata associated with documents. You can learn more about the operators and query structure in [Weaviate's conditional filters documentation](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/api/graphql/filters#filter-structure).

You can use both `AND` and `OR` with different operators. Operators are case insensitive:

## RabbitMQ credentials

**URL:** llms-txt#rabbitmq-credentials

**Contents:**
- Supported authentication methods
- Related resources
- Using user connection
- guest user issues

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [RabbitMQ](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.rabbitmq/)
- [RabbitMQ Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.rabbitmqtrigger/)

## Supported authentication methods

Refer to [RabbitMQ's Connections documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/connections) for more information about the service.

## Using user connection

To configure this credential, you'll need to have a [RabbitMQ broker](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) installed and:

1. Enter the **Hostname** for the RabbitMQ broker.
1. Enter the **Port** the connection should use.
1. Enter a **User** the connection should use to log in as.
   - The default is `guest`. RabbitMQ recommends using a different user in production environments. Refer to [Access Control | The Basics](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control#basics) for more information. If you're using the `guest` account with a non-localhost connection, refer to [`guest` user issues](#guest-user-issues) below for troubleshooting tips.
1. Enter the user's **Password**.
   - The default password for the `guest` user is `guest`.
1. Enter the [virtual host](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/vhosts) the connection should use as the **Vhost**. The default virtual host is `/`.
1. Select whether the connection should use **SSL**. If turned on, also set:
   - **Passwordless**: Select whether the SSL certificate connection users SASL mechanism EXTERNAL (turned off) or doesn't use a password (turned on). If turned on, you'll also need to enter:
     - The **Client Certificate**: Paste the text of the SSL client certificate to use.
     - The **Client Key**: Paste the SSL client key to use.
     - The **Passphrase**: Paste the SSL passphrase to use.
   - **CA Certificates**: Paste the text of the SSL CA certificates to use.

If you use the `guest` user for the credential and you try to access a remote host, you may see a connection error. The RabbitMQ logs show an error like this:

This happens because RabbitMQ prohibits the default `guest` user from connecting from remote hosts. It can only connect over the `localhost`.

To resolve this error, you can:

- Update the `guest` user to allow it remote host access.
- Create or use a different user to connect to the remote host. The `guest` user is the only user limited by default.

Refer to ["guest" user can only connect from localhost](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/access-control#loopback-users) for more information.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
[error] <0.918.0> PLAIN login refused: user 'guest' can only connect via localhost
```

## Call n8n Workflow Tool node

**URL:** llms-txt#call-n8n-workflow-tool-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Description
  - Source
  - Workflow Inputs
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

The Call n8n Workflow Tool node is a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) that allows an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to run another n8n workflow and fetch its output data.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Call n8n Workflow Tool node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

Enter a custom code a description. This tells the agent when to use this tool. For example:

> Call this tool to get a random color. The input should be a string with comma separated names of colors to exclude.

Tell n8n which workflow to call. You can choose either:

- **Database** to select the workflow from a list or enter a workflow ID.
- **Define Below** and copy in a complete [workflow JSON](../../../../../workflows/export-import/).

When using **Database** as workflow source, once you choose a sub-workflow (and define the **Workflow Input Schema** in the sub-workflow), you can define the **Workflow Inputs**.

Select the **Refresh** button to pull in the input fields from the sub-workflow.

You can define the workflow input values using any combination of the following options:

- providing fixed values
- using expressions to reference data from the current workflow
- [letting the AI model specify the parameter](../../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/) by selecting the button AI button on the right side of the field
- using the [`$fromAI()` function](../../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/#use-the-fromai-function) in expressions to control the way the model fills in data and to mix AI generated input with other custom input

To reference data from the current workflow, drag fields from the input panel to the field with the Expressions mode selected.

To get started with the `$fromAI()` function, select the "Let the model define this parameter" button on the right side of the field and then use the **X** on the box to revert to user-defined values. The field will change to an expression field pre-populated with the `$fromAI()` expression. From here, you can customize the expression to add other static or dynamic content, or tweak the `$fromAI()` function parameters.

## Stripe credentials

**URL:** llms-txt#stripe-credentials

**Contents:**
- Supported authentication methods
- Related resources
- Using API key
  - Live mode Secret key
  - Test mode Secret key
- Test mode and live mode
- Key prefixes

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Stripe Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stripetrigger/)
- [Stripe](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stripe/)

## Supported authentication methods

Refer to [Stripe's API documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/api) for more information about the service.

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) admin or developer account and:

- An API **Secret Key**

Before you generate an API key, decide whether to generate it in live mode or test mode. Refer to [Test mode and live mode](#test-mode-and-live-mode) for more information about the two modes.

### Live mode Secret key

To generate a Secret key in live mode:

1. Open the [Stripe developer dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/developers) and select [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys).
1. In the **Standard Keys** section, select **Create secret key**.
1. Enter a **Key name**, like `n8n integration`.
1. Select **Create**. The new API key displays.
1. Copy the key and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Secret Key**.

Refer to Stripe's [Create a secret API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#create-api-secret-key) for more information.

### Test mode Secret key

To use a Secret key in test mode, you must copy the existing one:

1. Go to your [Stripe test mode developer dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/developers) and select [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys).
1. In the **Standard Keys** section, select **Reveal test key** for the **Secret key**.
1. Copy the key and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Secret Key**.

Refer to Stripe's [Create a secret API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#create-api-secret-key) for more information.

## Test mode and live mode

All Stripe API requests happen within either [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode) or live mode. Each mode has its own API key.

Use test mode to access simulated test data and live mode to access actual account data. Objects in one mode aren’t accessible to the other.

Refer to [API keys | Test mode versus live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes) for more information about what's available in each mode and guidance on when to use each.

n8n credentials for both modes

If you want to work with both live mode and test mode keys, store each mode's key in a separate n8n credential.

Stripes' Secret keys always begin with `sk_`:

- Live keys begin with `sk_live_`.
- Test keys begin with `sk_test_`.

n8n hasn't tested these credentials with Restricted keys (prefixed `rk_`).

Don't use the Publishable keys (prefixed `pk_`) with your n8n credential.

## SearXNG Tool node

**URL:** llms-txt#searxng-tool-node

**Contents:**
- Node Options
- Running a SearXNG instance
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

The SearXNG Tool node allows you to integrate search capabilities into your workflows using SearXNG. SearXNG aggregates results from multiple search engines without tracking you.

On this page, you'll find the node options for the SearXNG Tool node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/searxng/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Number of Results**: The number of results to retrieve. The default is 10.
- **Page Number**: The page number of the search results to retrieve. The default is 1.
- **Language**: A two-letter [language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) to filter search results by language. For example: `en` for English, `fr` for French. The default is `en`.
- **Safe Search**: Enables or disables filtering explicit content in the search results. Can be None, Moderate, or Strict. The default is None.

## Running a SearXNG instance

This node requires running the SearXNG service on the same network as your n8n instance. Ensure your n8n instance has network access to the SearXNG service.

This node requires results in JSON format, which isn't enabled in the default SearXNG configuration. To enable JSON output, add `json` to the `search.formats` section of your SearXNG instance's `settings.yml` file:

If the `formats` section isn't there, add it. The exact location of the `settings.yml` file depends on how you installed SearXNG. You can find more by visiting the [SearXNG configuration documentation](https://docs.searxng.org/admin/installation-searxng.html#configuration).

The quality and availability of search results depend on the configuration and health of the SearXNG instance you use.

## Templates and examples

[Browse SearXNG Tool integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/searxng/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)

Refer to [SearXNG's documentation](https://docs.searxng.org/) for more information about the service. You can also view [LangChain's documentation on their SearXNG integration](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/searx_search/).

## Evaluation node

**URL:** llms-txt#evaluation-node

**Contents:**
- Operations
  - Set Outputs
  - Set Metrics
  - Check If Evaluating
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

The Evaluation node performs various operations related to [evaluations](../../../../advanced-ai/evaluations/overview/) to validate your AI workflow reliability.

Use the Evaluation node in these scenarios:

- To conditionally execute logic based on whether the workflow is under evaluation
- To write evaluation outcomes back to a Google Sheet datasetor
- To log scoring metrics for your evaluation performance to n8n's evaluations tab

Credentials for Google Sheets

The Evaluation node's **Set Outputs** operation records evaluation results to data tables or Google Sheets. To use Google Sheets as a recording location, configure a [Google Sheets credential](../../credentials/google/).

The Evaluation node offers the following operations:

- [**Set Outputs**](#set-outputs): Write the results of an evaluation back to a data table or Google Sheet dataset.
- [**Set Metrics**](#set-metrics): Record metrics scoring the evaluation performance to n8n's **Evaluations** tab.
- [**Check If Evaluating**](#check-if-evaluating): Branches the workflow execution logic depending on whether the current execution is an evaluation.

The parameters and options available depend on the operation you select.

The **Set Outputs** operation has the following parameters:

- **Source:** Select the location to which you want to output the evaluation results. Default value is **Data table**.

Source settings differ depending on **Source** selection.

You define the items to write to the data table or Google Sheet in the **Outputs** section. For each output, you set the following:

- **Name**: The Google Sheet column name to write the evaluation results to.
- **Value**: The value to write to the Google Sheet.

The **Set Metrics** operation includes a **Metrics to Return** section where you define the metrics to record and track for your evaluations. You can see the metric results in your workflow's **Evaluations** tab.

For each metric you wish to record, you set the following details:

- **Name**: The name to use for the metric.
- **Value**: The numeric value to record. Once you run your evaluation, you can drag and drop values from previous nodes here. Metric values must be numeric.

### Check If Evaluating

The **Check If Evaluating** operation doesn't have any parameters. This operation provides branching output connectors so that you can conditionally execute logic depending on whether the current execution is an evaluation or not.

To configure the webhook for your TheHive instance:

1. Copy the testing and production webhook URLs from TheHive Trigger node.

1. Add the following lines to the `application.conf` file. This is TheHive configuration file:

1. Replace `TESTING_WEBHOOK_URL` and `PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL` with the URLs you copied in the previous step.

1. Replace `TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME` and `PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME` with your preferred endpoint names.

1. Replace `ORGANIZATION_NAME` with your organization name.

1. Execute the following cURL command to enable notifications:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
notification.webhook.endpoints = [
   	{
   		name: TESTING_WEBHOOK_NAME
   		url: TESTING_WEBHOOK_URL
   		version: 1
   		wsConfig: {}
   		includedTheHiveOrganisations: ["ORGANIZATION_NAME"]
   		excludedTheHiveOrganisations: []
   	},
   	{
   		name: PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_NAME
   		url: PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL
   		version: 1
   		wsConfig: {}
   		includedTheHiveOrganisations: ["ORGANIZATION_NAME"]

## Cloud data management

**URL:** llms-txt#cloud-data-management

**Contents:**
- Memory limits on each Cloud plan
- How to reduce memory consumption in your workflow
- How to manage execution data on Cloud
- Cloud data pruning and out of memory incident prevention
  - Automatic data pruning
  - Manual data pruning

There are two concerns when managing data on Cloud:

- Memory usage: complex workflows processing large amounts of data can exceed n8n's memory limits. If this happens, the instance can crash and become inaccessible.
- Data storage: depending on your execution settings and volume, your n8n database can grow in size and run out of storage.

To avoid these issues, n8n recommends that you build your workflows with memory efficiency in mind, and don't save unnecessary data

## Memory limits on each Cloud plan

- Trial: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
- Starter: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
- Pro-1 (10k executions): 640MiB RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable
- Pro-2 (50k executions): 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable
- Enterprise: 4096MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

- Start: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable
- Power: 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable

n8n gives each instance up to 100GB of data storage.

## How to reduce memory consumption in your workflow

The way you build workflows affects how much data they consume when executed. Although these guidelines aren't applicable to all cases, they provide a baseline of best practices to avoid exceeding instance memory.

- Split the data processed into smaller chunks. For example, instead of fetching 10,000 rows with each execution, process 200 rows with each execution.
- Avoid using the Code node where possible.
- Avoid manual executions when processing larger amounts of data.
- Split the workflow up into sub-workflows and ensure each sub-workflow returns a limited amount of data to its parent workflow.

Splitting the workflow might seem counter-intuitive at first as it usually requires adding at least two more nodes: the [Loop Over Items](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to split up the items into smaller batches and the [Execute Workflow](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node to start the sub-workflow.

However, as long as your sub-workflow does the heavy lifting for each batch and then returns only a small result set to the main workflow, this reduces memory consumption. This is because the sub-workflow only holds the data for the current batch in memory, after which the memory is free again.

Note that n8n itself consumes memory to run. On average, the software alone uses around 180MiB RAM.

Interactions with the UI also consume memory. Playing around with the workflow UI while it performs heavy executions could also push the memory capacity over the limit.

## How to manage execution data on Cloud

Execution data includes node data, parameters, variables, execution context, and binary data references. It's text-based.

Binary data is non-textual data that n8n can't represent as plain text. This is files and media such as images, documents, audio files, and videos. It's much larger than textual data.

If a workflow consumes a large amounts of data and is past testing stage, it's a good option to stop saving the successful executions.

There are two ways you can control how much execution data n8n stores in the database:

In the admin dashboard:

1. From your workspace or editor, navigate to **Admin Panel**.
1. Select **Manage**.
1. In **Executions to Save** deselect the executions you don't want to log.

In your workflow settings:

1. Select the **Options** menu.
1. Select **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
1. Change **Save successful production executions** to **Do not save**.

## Cloud data pruning and out of memory incident prevention

### Automatic data pruning

n8n automatically prunes execution logs after a certain time or once you reach the max storage limit, whichever comes first. The pruning always happens from oldest to newest and the limits depend on your Could plan:

- Start and Starter plans: max 2500 executions saved and 7 days execution log retention;
- Pro and Power plans: max 25000 executions saved and 30 days execution log retention;
- Enterprise plan: max 50000 executions saved and unlimited execution log retention time.

### Manual data pruning

Heavier executions and use cases can exceed database capacity despite the automatic pruning practices. In cases like this, n8n will manually prune data to protect instance stability.

1. An alert system warns n8n if an instance is at 85% disk capacity.
1. n8n prunes execution data. n8n does this by running a backup of the instance (workflows, users, credentials and execution data) and restoring it without execution data.

Due to the human steps in this process, the alert system isn't perfect. If warnings are triggered after hours or if data consumption rates are high, there might not be time to prune the data before the remaining disk space fills up.

## Install community nodes from npm in the n8n app

**URL:** llms-txt#install-community-nodes-from-npm-in-the-n8n-app

**Contents:**
- Install a community node
- Uninstall a community node
- Upgrade a community node
  - Upgrade to the latest version
  - Upgrade to a specific version
- Downgrade a community node

Only for instance owners of self-hosted n8n instances

Only the n8n instance owner of a self-hosted n8n instance can install and manage community nodes from npm. The instance owner is the person who sets up and manages user management.

Admin accounts can also uninstall any community node, verified or unverified. This helps them remove problematic nodes that may affect the instance's health and functionality.

## Install a community node

To install a community node from npm:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Community Nodes**.
1. Select **Install**.
1. Find the node you want to install:
   1. Select **Browse**. n8n takes you to an npm search results page, showing all npm packages tagged with the keyword `n8n-community-node-package`.
   1. Browse the list of results. You can filter the results or add more keywords.
   1. Once you find the package you want, make a note of the package name. If you want to install a specific version, make a note of the version number as well.
   1. Return to n8n.
1. Enter the npm package name, and version number if required. For example, consider a community node designed to access a weather API called "Storms." The package name is n8n-node-storms, and it has three major versions.
   - To install the latest version of a package called n8n-node-weather: enter `n8n-nodes-storms` in **Enter npm package name**.
   - To install version 2.3: enter `n8n-node-storms@2.3` in **Enter npm package name**.
1. Agree to the [risks](../../risks/) of using community nodes: select **I understand the risks of installing unverified code from a public source.**
1. Select **Install**. n8n installs the node, and returns to the **Community Nodes** list in **Settings**.

Nodes on the blocklist

n8n maintains a blocklist of community nodes that it prevents you from installing. Refer to [n8n community node blocklist](../../blocklist/) for more information.

## Uninstall a community node

To uninstall a community node:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Community nodes**.
1. On the node you want to install, select **Options** .
1. Select **Uninstall package**.
1. Select **Uninstall Package** in the confirmation modal.

## Upgrade a community node

Breaking changes in versions

Node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes. If you find that an upgrade causes issues, you can [downgrade](#downgrade-a-community-node).

### Upgrade to the latest version

You can upgrade community nodes to the latest version from the node list in **Settings** > **community nodes**.

When a new version of a community node is available, n8n displays an **Update** button on the node. Click the button to upgrade to the latest version.

### Upgrade to a specific version

To upgrade to a specific version (a version other than the latest), uninstall the node, then reinstall it, making sure to specify the target version. Follow the [Installation](#install-a-community-node) instructions for more guidance.

## Downgrade a community node

If there is a problem with a particular version of a community node, you may want to roll back to a previous version.

To do this, uninstall the community node, then reinstall it, targeting a specific node version. Follow the [Installation](#install-a-community-node) instructions for more guidance.

## AI Agent node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#ai-agent-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Internal error: 400 Invalid value for 'content'
- Error in sub-node Simple Memory
- A Chat Model sub-node must be connected error
- No prompt specified error

Here are some common errors and issues with the [AI Agent node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Internal error: 400 Invalid value for 'content'

A full error message might look like this:

This error can occur if the **Prompt** input contains a null value.

You might see this in one of two scenarios:

1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and have an expression in your **Text** that isn't generating a value.
   - To resolve, make sure your expressions reference valid fields and that they resolve to valid input rather than null.
1. When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has null values.
   - To resolve, remove any null values from the `chatInput` field of the input node.

## Error in sub-node Simple Memory

This error displays when n8n runs into an issue with the [Simple Memory](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/) sub-node.

It most often occurs when your workflow or the workflow template you copied uses an older version of the Simple memory node (previously known as "Window Buffer Memory").

Try removing the Simple Memory node from your workflow and re-adding it, which will guarantee you're using the latest version of the node.

## A Chat Model sub-node must be connected error

This error displays when n8n tries to execute the node without having a Chat Model connected.

To resolve this, click the + Chat Model button at the bottom of your screen when the node is open, or click the Chat Model + connector when the node is closed. n8n will then open a selection of possible Chat Models to pick from.

## No prompt specified error

This error occurs when the agent expects to get the prompt from the previous node automatically. Typically, this happens when you're using the [Chat Trigger Node](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/).

To resolve this issue, find the **Prompt** parameter of the AI Agent node and change it from **Connected Chat Trigger Node** to **Define below**. This allows you to manually build your prompt by referencing output data from other nodes or by adding static text.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
Internal error
Error: 400 Invalid value for 'content': expected a string, got null.
<stack-trace>
```

The MultiQuery Retriever node automates the process of prompt tuning by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input query.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the MultiQuery Retriever node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Query Count**: Enter how many different versions of the query to generate.

## Branch execution with If and Merge nodes

n8n removed this execution behavior in version 1.0. This section applies to workflows using the **v0 (legacy)** workflow execution order. By default, this is all workflows built before version 1.0. You can change the execution order in your [workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/).

If you add a Merge node to a workflow containing an If node, it can result in both output data streams of the If node executing.

One data stream triggers the Merge node, which then goes and executes the other data stream.

For example, in the screenshot below there's a workflow containing an Edit Fields node, If node, and Merge node. The standard If node behavior is to execute one data stream (in the screenshot, this is the **true** output). However, due to the Merge node, both data streams execute, despite the If node not sending any data down the **false** data stream.

Refer to [Splitting with conditionals](../../../../flow-logic/splitting/) for more information on using conditionals to create complex logic in n8n.

If you need more than two conditional outputs, use the [Switch node](../n8n-nodes-base.switch/).

## Loop Over Items

**URL:** llms-txt#loop-over-items

**Contents:**
- When to use the Loop Over Items node
- Node parameters
  - Batch Size
- Node options
  - Reset
- Templates and examples
  - Read RSS feed from two different sources
  - Check that the node has processed all items
  - Get the current running index of the node

The Loop Over Items node helps you loop through data when needed.

The node saves the original incoming data, and with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data through the **loop** output.

When the node execution completes, it combines all of the processed data and returns it through the **done** output.

## When to use the Loop Over Items node

By default, n8n nodes are designed to process a list of input items (with some exceptions, detailed below). Depending on what you're trying to achieve, you often don't need the Loop Over Items node in your workflow. You can learn more about how n8n processes multiple items on the [looping in n8n](../../../../flow-logic/looping/) page.

These links highlight some of the cases where the Loop Over Items node can be useful:

- [Loop until all items are processed](../../../../flow-logic/looping/#loop-until-all-items-are-processed): describes how the Loop Over Items node differs from normal item processing and when you might want to incorporate this node.
- [Node exceptions](../../../../flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions): outlines specific cases and nodes where you may need to use the Loop Over Items node to manually build looping logic.
- [Avoiding rate limiting](../../rate-limits/): demonstrates how to batch API requests to avoid rate limits from other services.

Enter the number of items to return with each call.

If turned on, the node will reset with the current input-data newly initialized with each loop. Use this when you want the Loop Over Items node to treat incoming data as a new set of data instead of a continuation of previous items.

For example, you can use the Loop Over Items node with the reset option and an [If node](../n8n-nodes-base.if/) to query a paginated service when you don't know how many pages you need in advance. The loop queries pages one at a time, performs any processing, and increments the page number. The loop reset ensures the loop recognizes each iteration as a new set of data. The If node evaluates an exit condition to decide whether to perform another iteration or not.

Include a valid termination condition

For workflows like the example described above, it's critical to include a valid termination condition for the loop. If your termination condition never matches, your workflow execution will get stuck in an infinite loop.

When enabled, you can adjust the reset conditions by switching the parameter representation from **Fixed** to **Expression**. The results of your expression evaluation determine when the node will reset item processing.

### Read RSS feed from two different sources

This workflow allows you to read an RSS feed from two different sources using the Loop Over Items node. You need the Loop Over Items node in the workflow as the RSS Feed Read node only processes the first item it receives. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/687-read-rss-feed-from-two-different-sources/) on n8n.io.

The example walks through building the workflow, but assumes you are already familiar with n8n. To build your first workflow, including learning how to add nodes to a workflow, refer to [Try it out](../../../../try-it-out/).

The final workflow looks like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/rss-feed-example.json)

Copy the workflow file above and paste into your instance, or manually build it by following these steps:

1. Add the manual trigger.

1. Add the Code node.

1. Copy this code into the Code node:

1. Add the Loop Over Items node.

1. Configure Loop Over Items: set the batch size to `1` in the **Batch Size** field.

1. Add the RSS Feed Read node.

1. Select **Execute Workflow**. This runs the workflow to load data into the RSS Feed Read node.

1. Configure RSS Feed Read: map `url` from the input to the **URL** field. You can do this by dragging and dropping from the **INPUT** panel, or using this expression: `{{ $json.url }}`.

1. Select **Execute Workflow** to run the workflow and see the resulting data.

### Check that the node has processed all items

To check if the node still has items to process, use the following expression: `{{$node["Loop Over Items"].context["noItemsLeft"]}}`. This expression returns a boolean value. If the node still has data to process, the expression returns `false`, otherwise it returns `true`.

### Get the current running index of the node

To get the current running index of the node, use the following expression: `{{$node["Loop Over Items"].context["currentRunIndex"];}}`.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
return [
   	{
   		json: {
   			url: 'https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io',
   		}
   	},
   	{
   		json: {
   			url: 'https://dev.to/feed/n8n',
   		}
   	}
   ];
```

## Telegram Trigger node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#telegram-trigger-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Stuck waiting for trigger event
- Bad request: bad webhook: An HTTPS URL must be provided for webhook
- Workflow only works in testing or production

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Telegram Trigger node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Stuck waiting for trigger event

When testing the Telegram Trigger node with the **Execute step** or **Execute workflow** buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.

Stuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.

To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.

## Bad request: bad webhook: An HTTPS URL must be provided for webhook

This error occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy and there is a problem with your instance's webhook URL.

When running n8n behind a reverse proxy, you must [configure the `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable](../../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/) with the public URL where your n8n instance is running. For Telegram, this URL must use HTTPS.

To fix this issue, configure TLS/SSL termination in your reverse proxy. Afterward, update your `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable to use the HTTPS address.

## Workflow only works in testing or production

Telegram only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Telegram overwrites the registered webhook URL.

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. The Telegram bot will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can either disable your workflow when testing or create separate Telegram bots for testing and production.

To create a separate telegram bot for testing, repeat the process you completed to create your first bot. Reference [Telegram's bot documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots) and the [Telegram bot API reference](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) for more information.

To disable your workflow when testing, try the following:

Halts production traffic

This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.

1. Go to your workflow page.
1. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
1. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
1. When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

## Embeddings Mistral Cloud node

**URL:** llms-txt#embeddings-mistral-cloud-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
- Node options
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

Use the Embeddings Mistral Cloud node to generate [embeddings](../../../../../glossary/#ai-embedding) for a given text.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings Mistral Cloud node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/mistral/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Model**: Select the model to use to generate the embedding.

Learn more about available models in [Mistral's models documentation](https://docs.mistral.ai/platform/pricing/).

- **Batch Size**: Enter the maximum number of documents to send in each request.
- **Strip New Lines**: Select whether to remove new line characters from input text (turned on) or not (turned off). n8n enables this by default.

## Item linking in the Code node

**URL:** llms-txt#item-linking-in-the-code-node

**Contents:**
  - `pairedItem` usage example

Use n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. It also has implications when using the Code node. Most nodes link every output item to an input item. This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. For a deeper conceptual overview of this topic, refer to [Item linking concepts](../item-linking-concepts/). This document focuses on practical usage examples.

When using the Code node, there are some scenarios where you need to manually supply item linking information if you want to be able to use `$("<node-name>").item` later in the workflow. All these scenarios only apply if you have more than one incoming item. n8n automatically handles item linking for single items.

These scenarios are when you:

- Add new items: the new items aren't linked to any input.
- Return new items.
- Want to manually control the item linking.

[n8n's automatic item linking](../item-linking-concepts/) handles the other scenarios.

To control item linking, set `pairedItem` when returning data. For example, to link to the item at index 0:

### `pairedItem` usage example

Take this input data:

And use it to generate new items, containing just the name, along with a new piece of data:

`newItems` is an array of items with no `pairedItem`. This means there's no way to trace back from these items to the items used to generate them.

Add the `pairedItem` object:

Each new item now links to the item used to create it.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
[
	{
		"json": {
			. . . 
		},
		// The index of the input item that generated this output item
		"pairedItem": 0
	}
]
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
[
  {
    "id": "23423532",
    "name": "Jay Gatsby"
  },
  {
    "id": "23423533",
    "name": "José Arcadio Buendía"
  },
  {
    "id": "23423534",
    "name": "Max Sendak"
  },
  {
    "id": "23423535",
    "name": "Zaphod Beeblebrox"
  },
  {
    "id": "23423536",
    "name": "Edmund Pevensie"
  }
]
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
newItems = [];
for(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){
  newItems.push(
    {
    "json":
      {
        "name": items[i].json.name,
				"aBrandNewField": "New data for item " + i
      }
    }
  )
}

return newItems;
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
newItems = [];
for(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){
  newItems.push(
    {
      "json":
        {
          "name": items[i].json.name,
					"aBrandNewField": "New data for item " + i
        },
      "pairedItem": i
    }    
  )

## MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node

**URL:** llms-txt#mongodb-atlas-vector-store-node

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Node usage patterns
  - Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents
  - Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool
  - Use a retriever to fetch documents
  - Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions
- Node parameters
  - Operation Mode
  - Rerank Results
  - Get Many parameters

MongoDB Atlas Vector Search is a feature of MongoDB Atlas that enables users to store and query vector embeddings. Use this node to interact with Vector Search indexes in your MongoDB Atlas collections. You can insert documents, retrieve documents, and use the vector store in chains or as a tool for agents.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/mongodb/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

Before using this node, create a [Vector Search index](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/vector-search-type/) in your MongoDB Atlas collection. Follow these steps to create one:

1. Log in to the [MongoDB Atlas dashboard](https://cloud.mongodb.com/).

1. Select your organization and project.

1. Find "Search & Vector Search" section.

1. Select your cluster and click "Go to search".

1. Click "Create Search Index".

1. Choose "Vector Search" mode and use the visual or JSON editors. For example:

1. Adjust the "dimensions" value according to your embedding model (For example, `1536` for OpenAI's `text-embedding-small-3`).

1. Name your index and create.

Make sure to note the following values which are required when configuring the node:

- Collection name
- Vector index name
- Field names for embeddings and metadata

## Node usage patterns

You can use the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node in the following patterns:

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents

You can use the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (the template uses the Supabase Vector Store, but the pattern is the same).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use the vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node to fetch documents from the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the linked example uses Pinecone, but the pattern is the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> MongoDB Atlas Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the MongoDB Atlas Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarize data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2465-building-your-first-whatsapp-chatbot/) (the linked example uses the In-Memory Vector Store, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> In-Memory Vector store.

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt is embedded and used for similarity search. The node returns the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents

Use insert documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Tool for AI Agent)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters

- **Mongo Collection**: Enter the name of the MongoDB collection to use.
- **Vector Index Name**: Enter the name of the Vector Search index in your MongoDB Atlas collection.
- **Embedding Field**: Enter the field name in your documents that contains the vector embeddings.
- **Metadata Field**: Enter the field name in your documents that contains the text metadata.

### Insert Documents parameters

## Error handling in n8n nodes

**URL:** llms-txt#error-handling-in-n8n-nodes

**Contents:**
- NodeApiError
  - Common usage patterns
- NodeOperationError
  - Common usage patterns

Proper error handling is crucial for creating robust n8n nodes that provide clear feedback to users when things go wrong. n8n provides two specialized error classes to handle different types of failures in node implementations:

- [**`NodeApiError`**](#nodeapierror): For API-related errors and external service failures
- [**`NodeOperationError`**](#nodeoperationerror): For operational errors, validation failures, and configuration issues

Use `NodeApiError` when dealing with external API calls and HTTP requests. This error class is specifically designed to handle API response errors and provides enhanced features for parsing and presenting API-related failures such as:

- HTTP request failures
- external API errors
- authentication/authorization failures
- rate limiting errors
- service unavailable errors

Initialize new `NodeApiError` instances using the following pattern:

### Common usage patterns

For basic API request failures, catch the error and wrap it in `NodeApiError`:

Handle specific HTTP status codes with custom messages:

## NodeOperationError

Use `NodeOperationError` for:

- operational errors
- validation failures
- configuration issues that aren't related to external API calls
- input validation errors
- missing required parameters
- data transformation errors
- workflow logic errors

Initialize new `NodeOperationError` instances using the following pattern:

### Common usage patterns

Use `NodeOperationError` for validating user inputs:

When processing multiple items, include the item index for better error context:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
new NodeApiError(node: INode, errorResponse: JsonObject, options?: NodeApiErrorOptions)
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
try {
	const response = await this.helpers.requestWithAuthentication.call(
		this,
		credentialType,
		options
	);
	return response;
} catch (error) {
	throw new NodeApiError(this.getNode(), error as JsonObject);
}
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
try {
	const response = await this.helpers.requestWithAuthentication.call(
		this,
		credentialType,
		options
	);
	return response;
} catch (error) {
	if (error.httpCode === "404") {
		const resource = this.getNodeParameter("resource", 0) as string;
		const errorOptions = {
			message: `${
				resource.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + resource.slice(1)
			} not found`,
			description:
				"The requested resource could not be found. Please check your input parameters.",
		};
		throw new NodeApiError(
			this.getNode(),
			error as JsonObject,
			errorOptions
		);
	}

	if (error.httpCode === "401") {
		throw new NodeApiError(this.getNode(), error as JsonObject, {
			message: "Authentication failed",
			description: "Please check your credentials and try again.",
		});
	}

	throw new NodeApiError(this.getNode(), error as JsonObject);
}
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
new NodeOperationError(node: INode, error: Error | string | JsonObject, options?: NodeOperationErrorOptions)
```

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Model**: Select the model to use to generate the completion.

- **Frequency Penalty**: Use this option to control the chances of the model repeating itself. Higher values reduce the chance of the model repeating itself.
- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.
- **Response Format**: Choose **Text** or **JSON**. **JSON** ensures the model returns valid JSON.
- **Presence Penalty**: Use this option to control the chances of the model talking about new topics. Higher values increase the chance of the model talking about new topics.
- **Sampling Temperature**: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.
- **Timeout**: Enter the maximum request time in milliseconds.
- **Max Retries**: Enter the maximum number of times to retry a request.
- **Top P**: Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

This node doesn't support the [`NO_PROXY` environment variable](../../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/).

- Scopes
- Common issues
  - Token expired

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [Slack](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/)
- [Slack Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/)

## Supported authentication methods

- API access token:
  - Required for the [Slack Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/) node.
  - Works with the [Slack](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/) node, but not recommended.
- OAuth2:
  - Recommended method for the [Slack](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/) node.
  - Doesn't work with the [Slack Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/) node.

Refer to [Slack's API documentation](https://api.slack.com/apis) for more information about the service.

## Using API access token

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Slack](https://slack.com/) account and:

- An **Access Token**

To generate an access token, create a Slack app:

1. Open your [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) page.
1. Select **Create New App > From scratch**.
1. Enter an **App Name**.
1. Select the **Workspace** where you'll be developing your app.
1. Select **Create App**. The app details open.
1. In the left menu under **Features**, select **OAuth & Permissions**.
1. In the **Scopes** section, select appropriate scopes for your app. Refer to [Scopes](#scopes) for a list of recommended scopes.
1. After you've added scopes, go up to the **OAuth Tokens** section and select **Install to Workspace**. You must be a Slack workspace admin to complete this action.
1. Select **Allow**.
1. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** and enter it as the **Access Token** in your n8n credential.
1. If you're using this credential for the [Slack Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/), follow the steps in [Slack Trigger configuration](#slack-trigger-configuration) to finish setting up your app.

Refer to the Slack API [Quickstart](https://api.slack.com/quickstart) for more information.

### Slack Trigger configuration

To use your Slack app with the [Slack Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slacktrigger/) node:

1. Go to [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps/) in Slack and select the app you want to use.

1. Go to **Features** > **Event Subscriptions**.

1. Turn on the **Enable Events** control.

1. In n8n, copy the **Webhook URL** and enter it as the **Request URL** in your Slack app.

Slack only allows one request URL per app. If you want to test your workflow, you'll need to do one of the following:

- Test with your **Test URL** first, then change your Slack app to use the **Production URL** once you've verified everything's working
   - Use the **Production URL** with execution logging.

1. Once verified, select the bot events to subscribe to. Use the **Trigger on** field in n8n to filter these requests.

- To use an event not in the list, add it as a bot event and select **Any Event** in the n8n node.

Refer to [Quickstart | Configuring the app for event listening](https://api.slack.com/quickstart#listening) for more information.

n8n recommends enabling request signature verification for your Slack Trigger for additional security:

1. Go to [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps/) in Slack and select the app you want to use.
1. Go to **Settings** > **Basic Information**.
1. Copy the value of **Signing**.
1. In n8n, Paste this value into the **Signature Secret** field for the credential.

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you're [self-hosting n8n](../../../../hosting/) and need to configure OAuth2 from scratch, you'll need a [Slack](https://slack.com/) account and:

- A **Client ID**
- A **Client Secret**

To get both, create a Slack app:

1. Open your [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) page.
1. Select **Create New App > From scratch**.
1. Enter an **App Name**.
1. Select the **Workspace** where you'll be developing your app.
1. Select **Create App**. The app details open.
1. In **Settings > Basic Information**, open the **App Credentials** section.
1. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Paste these into the corresponding fields in n8n.
1. In the left menu under **Features**, select **OAuth & Permissions**.
1. In the **Redirect URLs** section, select **Add New Redirect URL**.
1. Copy the **OAuth Callback URL** from n8n and enter it as the new Redirect URL in Slack.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Select **Save URLs**.
1. In the **Scopes** section, select appropriate scopes for your app. Refer to [Scopes](#scopes) for a list of scopes.
1. After you've added scopes, go up to the **OAuth Tokens** section and select **Install to Workspace**. You must be a Slack workspace admin to complete this action.
1. Select **Allow**.
1. At this point, you should be able to select the OAuth button in your n8n credential to connect.

Refer to the Slack API [Quickstart](https://api.slack.com/quickstart) for more information. Refer to the Slack [Installing with OAuth](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2) documentation for more details on the OAuth flow itself.

Scopes determine what permissions an app has.

- If you want your app to act on behalf of users who authorize the app, add the required scopes under the **User Token Scopes** section.
- If you're building a bot, add the required scopes under the **Bot Token Scopes** section.

Here's the list of scopes the OAuth credential requires, which are a good starting point:

| **Scope name**        | **Notes**                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `channels:read`       |                                    |
| `channels:write`      | Not available as a bot token scope |
| `channels:history`    |                                    |
| `chat:write`          |                                    |

| `usergroups:write`    |                                    |
| `users.profile:read`  |                                    |
| `users.profile:write` | Not available as a bot token scope |
| `users:read`          |                                    |
| `search:read`         |                                    |

Slack offers **token rotation** that you can turn on for bot and user tokens. This makes every tokens expire after 12 hours. While this may be useful for testing, n8n credentials using tokens with this enabled will fail after expiry. If you want to use your Slack credentials in production, this feature must be **off**.

To check if your Slack app has token rotation turned on, refer to the [Slack API Documentation | Token Rotation](https://api.slack.com/authentication/rotation).

If your app uses token rotation

Please note, if your Slack app uses token rotation, you can't turn it off again. You need to create a new Slack app with token rotation disabled instead.

## OpenRouter Chat Model node

**URL:** llms-txt#openrouter-chat-model-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Model
- Node options
  - Frequency Penalty
  - Maximum Number of Tokens
  - Response Format
  - Presence Penalty
  - Sampling Temperature
  - Timeout
  - Max Retries

Use the OpenRouter Chat Model node to use OpenRouter's chat models with conversational agents.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the OpenRouter Chat Model node and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/openrouter/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

Select the model to use to generate the completion.

n8n dynamically loads models from OpenRouter and you'll only see the models available to your account.

Use these options to further refine the node's behavior.

### Frequency Penalty

Use this option to control the chances of the model repeating itself. Higher values reduce the chance of the model repeating itself.

### Maximum Number of Tokens

Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.

Choose **Text** or **JSON**. **JSON** ensures the model returns valid JSON.

Use this option to control the chances of the model talking about new topics. Higher values increase the chance of the model talking about new topics.

### Sampling Temperature

Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.

Enter the maximum request time in milliseconds.

Enter the maximum number of times to retry a request.

Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

## Demonstration of key differences between agents and chains

**URL:** llms-txt#demonstration-of-key-differences-between-agents-and-chains

**Contents:**
- Key features
- Using the example

In this workflow you can choose whether your chat query goes to an [agent](../../../glossary/#ai-agent) or [chain](../../../glossary/#ai-chain). It shows some of the ways that agents are more powerful than chains.

[View workflow file](/_workflows/advanced-ai/examples/agents_vs_chains.json)

- [Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/): start your workflow and respond to user chat interactions. The node provides a customizable chat interface.
- [Switch node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/): directs your query to either the agent or chain, depending on which you specify in your query. If you say "agent" it sends it to the agent. If you say "chain" it sends it to the chain.
- [Agent](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): the Agent node interacts with other components of the workflow and makes decisions about what [tools](../../../glossary/#ai-tool) to use.
- [Basic LLM Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/): the Basic LLM Chain node supports chatting with a connected LLM, but doesn't support [memory](../../../glossary/#ai-memory) or tools.

To load the template into your n8n instance:

## Gmail node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#gmail-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages
- Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials
- 401 unauthorized error
- Bad request - please check your parameters

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Gmail node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages

If you're using the node to [send a message](../message-operations/#send-a-message) or [reply to a message](../message-operations/#reply-to-a-message), the node appends this statement to the end of the email:

> This email was sent automatically with n8n

To remove this attribution:

1. In the node's **Options** section, select **Add option**.
1. Select **Append n8n attribution**.
1. Turn the toggle off.

Refer to [Send options](../message-operations/#send-options) and [Reply options](../message-operations/#reply-options) for more information.

## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials

This error displays next to certain dropdowns in the node, like the **Label Names or IDs** dropdown. The full text looks something like this:

The error most often displays when you're using a Google Service Account as the credential and the credential doesn't have **Impersonate a User** turned on.

Refer to [Google Service Account: Finish your n8n credential](../../../credentials/google/service-account/#finish-your-n8n-credential) for more information.

## 401 unauthorized error

The full text of the error looks like this:

This error occurs when there's an issue with the credential you're using and its scopes or permissions.

1. For [OAuth2](../../../credentials/google/oauth-single-service/) credentials, make sure you've enabled the Gmail API in **APIs & Services > Library**. Refer to [Google OAuth2 Single Service - Enable APIs](../../../credentials/google/oauth-single-service/#enable-apis) for more information.
1. For [Service Account](../../../credentials/google/service-account/) credentials:
   1. [Enable domain-wide delegation](../../../credentials/google/service-account/#enable-domain-wide-delegation).
   1. Make sure you add the Gmail API as part of the domain-wide delegation configuration.

## Bad request - please check your parameters

This error most often occurs if you enter a Message ID, Thread ID, or Label ID that doesn't exist.

Try a **Get** operation with the ID to confirm it exists.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
There was a problem loading the parameter options from server: "Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?"
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
401 - {"error":"unauthorized_client","error_description":"Client is unauthorized to retrieve access tokens using this method, or client not authorized for any of the scopes requested."}
```

## HTTP Request Tool node

**URL:** llms-txt#http-request-tool-node

**Contents:**
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

New instances of the HTTP Request tool node that you add to workflows use the standard [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node as a tool. This page is describes the legacy, standalone HTTP Request tool node.

You can identify which tool version is in your workflow by checking if the node has an **Add option** property when you open the node on the canvas. If that button is present, you're using the new version, not the one described on this page.

The HTTP Request tool works just like the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node, but it's designed to be used with an [AI agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) as a tool to collect information from a website or API.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the HTTP Request node supports and links to more resources.

Refer to [HTTP Request credentials](../../../credentials/httprequest/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Templates and examples

## OpenAI node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#openai-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- The service is receiving too many requests from you
- Insufficient quota
- Bad request - please check your parameters
- Referenced node is unexecuted

Here are some common errors and issues with the [OpenAI node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## The service is receiving too many requests from you

This error displays when you've exceeded [OpenAI's rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits).

There are two ways to work around this issue:

1. Split your data up into smaller chunks using the [Loop Over Items](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node and add a [Wait](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) node at the end for a time amount that will help. Copy the code below and paste it into a workflow to use as a template.

1. Use the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node with the built-in batch-limit option against the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) instead of using the OpenAI node.

## Insufficient quota

There are a number of OpenAI issues surrounding quotas, including failures when quotas have been recently topped up. To avoid these issues, ensure that there is credit in the account and issue a new API key from the [API keys screen](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).

This error displays when your OpenAI account doesn't have enough credits or capacity to fulfill your request. This may mean that your OpenAI trial period has ended, that your account needs more credit, or that you've gone over a usage limit.

To troubleshoot this error, on your [OpenAI settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) page:

- Select the correct organization for your API key in the first selector in the upper-left corner.
- Select the correct project for your API key in the second selector in the upper-left corner.
- Check the organization-level [billing overview](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) page to ensure that the organization has enough credit. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page.
- Check the organization-level [usage limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) page. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page and scroll to the **Usage limits** section to verify that you haven't exceeded your organization's usage limits.
- Check your OpenAI project's usage limits. Double-check that you select the correct project in the second selector in the upper-left corner. Select **Project** > **Limits** to view or change the project limits.
- Check that the [OpenAI API](https://status.openai.com/) is operating as expected.

Balance waiting period

After topping up your balance, there may be a delay before your OpenAI account reflects the new balance.

- check that the [OpenAI credentials](../../../credentials/openai/) use a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for the account you've added money to
- ensure that you connect the [OpenAI node](../) to the correct [OpenAI credentials](../../../credentials/openai/)

If you find yourself frequently running out of account credits, consider turning on auto recharge in your [OpenAI billing settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) to automatically reload your account with credits when your balance reaches $0.

## Bad request - please check your parameters

This error displays when the request results in an error but n8n wasn't able to interpret the error message from OpenAI.

To begin troubleshooting, try running the same operation using the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node, which should provide a more detailed error message.

## Referenced node is unexecuted

This error displays when a previous node in the workflow hasn't executed and isn't providing output that this node needs as input.

The full text of this error will tell you the exact node that isn't executing in this format:

To begin troubleshooting, test the workflow up to the named node.

For nodes that call JavaScript or other custom code, determine if a node has executed before trying to use the value by calling:

## Chat Memory Manager node

**URL:** llms-txt#chat-memory-manager-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

The Chat Memory Manager node manages chat message [memories](../../../../../glossary/#ai-memory) within your workflows. Use this node to load, insert, and delete chat messages in an in-memory [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store).

This node is useful when you:

- Can't add a memory node directly.
- Need to do more complex memory management, beyond what the memory nodes offer. For example, you can add this node to check the memory size of the Agent node's response, and reduce it if needed.
- Want to inject messages to the AI that look like user messages, to give the AI more context.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations that the Chat Memory Manager node supports, along with links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Operation Mode**: Choose between **Get Many Messages**, **Insert Messages**, and **Delete Messages** operations.
- **Insert Mode**: Available in **Insert Messages** mode. Choose from:
  - **Insert Messages**: Insert messages alongside existing messages.
  - **Override All Messages**: Replace current memory.
- **Delete Mode**: available in **Delete Messages** mode. Choose from:
  - **Last N**: Delete the last N messages.
  - **All Messages**: Delete messages from memory.
- **Chat Messages**: available in **Insert Messages** mode. Define the chat messages to insert into the memory, including:
  - **Type Name or ID**: Set the message type. Select one of:
    - **AI**: Use this for messages from the AI.
    - **System**: Add a message containing instructions for the AI.
    - **User**: Use this for messages from the user. This message type is sometimes called the 'human' message in other AI tools and guides.
  - **Message**: Enter the message contents.
  - **Hide Message in Chat**: Select whether n8n should display the message to the user in the chat UI (turned off) or not (turned on).
- **Messages Count**: Available in **Delete Messages** mode when you select **Last N**. Enter the number of latest messages to delete.
- **Simplify Output**: Available in **Get Many Messages** mode. Turn on to simplify the output to include only the sender (AI, user, or system) and the text.

View n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.

## Single memory instance

If you add more than one Motorhead node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](../n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.

## Sub-workflow conversion

**URL:** llms-txt#sub-workflow-conversion

**Contents:**
- Selecting nodes for a sub-workflow
- How to convert part of a workflow to a sub-workflow
- Things to keep in mind

Available on all plans from n8n version 1.97.0.

Use sub-workflow conversion to refactor your workflows into reusable parts. Expressions referencing other nodes are automatically updated and added as parameters in the [Execute Workflow Trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/) node.

See [sub-workflows](../../flow-logic/subworkflows/) for a general introduction to the concept.

## Selecting nodes for a sub-workflow

To convert part of a workflow to a sub-workflow, you must select the nodes in the original workflow that you want to convert.

Do this by selecting a group of valid nodes. The selection must be continuous and must connect to the rest of the workflow from at most one start node and one end node. The selection must fulfill these conditions:

- Must not include trigger nodes.
- Only a single node in the selection can have incoming connections from nodes *outside* of the selection.
  - That node can have multiple incoming connections, but only a single input *branch* (which means it can't be a [Merge node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) for example).
  - That node can't have incoming connections from other nodes in the selection.
- Only a single node in the selection can have outgoing connections to nodes *outside* of the selection.
  - That node can have multiple outgoing connections, but only a single output branch (it can't be an [If node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) for example).
  - That node can't have outgoing connections to other nodes in the selection.
- The selection must include all nodes between the input and output nodes.

## How to convert part of a workflow to a sub-workflow

Select the desired nodes on the canvas. Right-click the canvas background and select **Convert to sub-workflow**.

## Things to keep in mind

Most sub-workflow conversions work without issues, but there are some caveats and limitations to keep in mind:

- **You must set type constraints for input and output manually**: By default, sub-workflow input and output allow all types. You can set expected types in sub-workflow's [Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/) and [Edit Fields (set) node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) (labeled as **Return** and only included if the sub-workflow has outputs).

- **Limited support for AI nodes**: When dealing with sub-nodes like AI tools, you must select them all and may need to duplicate any nodes shared with other AI Agents before conversion.

- **Uses v1 execution ordering:** New workflows use [`v1` execution ordering](../../flow-logic/execution-order/) regardless of the parent workflow's settings - you can change this back in the settings.

- **Accessor functions like `first()`, `last()`, and `all()` require extra care**: Expressions using these functions don't always translate cleanly to a sub-workflow context. n8n may transform them to try to preserve their functionality, but you should check that they work as intended in their new context.

Sub-node parameter suffixes

n8n adds suffixes like `_firstItem`, `_lastItem`, and `_allItems` to variable names accessed by these functions. This helps preserve information about the original expression, since item ordering may be different in the sub-workflow context.

- **The `itemMatching` function requires a fixed index**: You can't use expressions for the index value when using the [`itemMatching` function](../../code/builtin/output-other-nodes/). You must pass it a fixed number.

## Submit community nodes

**URL:** llms-txt#submit-community-nodes

**Contents:**
- Standards
- Submit your node for verification by n8n

Community nodes are npm packages, hosted in the npm registry.

When building a node to submit to the community node repository, use the following resources to make sure your node setup is correct:

- n8n recommends using the [`n8n-node` CLI tool](../../build/n8n-node/) to build and test your node. In particular, this is important if you plan on [submitting your node for verification](./#submit-your-node-for-verification-by-n8n). This ensures that your node has the correct structure and follows community node requirements. It also simplifies linting and testing.
- View [n8n's own nodes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes) for examples of patterns you can use in your nodes.
- Refer to the documentation on [building your own nodes](../../overview/).
- Make sure your node follows the [standards](#standards) for community nodes.

Developing with the [`n8n-node` tool](../../build/n8n-node/) ensures that your node adheres to the following standards required to make your node available in the n8n community node repository:

- Make sure the package name starts with `n8n-nodes-` or `@<scope>/n8n-nodes-`. For example, `n8n-nodes-weather` or `@weatherPlugins/n8n-nodes-weather`.
- Include `n8n-community-node-package` in your package keywords.
- Make sure that you add your nodes and credentials to the `package.json` file inside the `n8n` attribute.
- Check your node using the linter (`npm run lint`) and test it locally (`npm run dev`) to ensure it works.
- Submit the package to the npm registry. Refer to npm's documentation on [Contributing packages to the registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry) for more information.

## Submit your node for verification by n8n

n8n vets verified community nodes. Users can discover and install verified community nodes from the nodes panel in n8n. These nodes need to adhere to certain technical and UX standards and constraints.

Before submitting your node for review by n8n, you must:

- Start from the [`n8n-node` tool](../../build/n8n-node/) generated scaffolding. While this isn't strictly required, n8n strongly suggests using the `n8n-node` CLI tool for any community node you plan to submit for verification. Using the tool ensures that your node follows the expected conventions and adheres to the community node requirements.
- Make sure that your node follows the [technical guidelines for verified community nodes](../../build/reference/verification-guidelines/) and that all automated checks pass. Specifically, verified community nodes aren't allowed to use any run-time dependencies.
- Ensure that your node follows the [UX guidelines](../../build/reference/ux-guidelines/).
- Make sure that the node has appropriate documentation in the form of a README in the [npm package](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-package-readme-files) or a related public repository.
- Submit your node to npm as n8n will fetch it from there for final vetting.

If your node meets all the above requirements, sign up or log in to the [n8n Creator Portal](https://creators.n8n.io/nodes) and submit your node for verification. Note that n8n reserves the right to reject nodes that compete with any of n8n's paid features, especially enterprise functionality.

## Embeddings HuggingFace Inference node

**URL:** llms-txt#embeddings-huggingface-inference-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
- Node options
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

Use the Embeddings HuggingFace Inference node to generate [embeddings](../../../../../glossary/#ai-embedding) for a given text.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings HuggingFace Inference, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/huggingface/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Model**: Select the model to use to generate the embedding.

Refer to the [Hugging Face models documentation](https://huggingface.co/models?other=embeddings) for available models.

- **Custom Inference Endpoint**: Enter the URL of your deployed model, hosted by HuggingFace. If you set this, n8n ignores the **Model Name**.

Refer to [HuggingFace's guide to inference](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints) for more information.

- **Data Format**: Displays when you set **Type of Data** to **Binary**. Select the file MIME type for your binary data. Set to **Automatically Detect by MIME Type** if you want n8n to set the data format for you. If you set a specific data format and the incoming file MIME type doesn't match it, the node errors. If you use **Automatically Detect by MIME Type**, the node falls back to text format if it can't match the file MIME type to a supported data format.

- **Metadata**: Set the metadata that should accompany the document in the vector store. This is what you match to using the **Metadata Filter** option when retrieving data using the vector store nodes.

## Airtable node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#airtable-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials
- Service is receiving too many requests from you

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Airtable node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials

This error displays when trying to perform actions not permitted by your current level of access. The full text looks something like this:

The error most often displays when the credential you're using doesn't have the scopes it requires on the resources you're attempting to manage.

Refer to the [Airtable credentials](../../../credentials/airtable/) and [Airtables scopes documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/scopes) for more information.

## Service is receiving too many requests from you

Airtable has a hard API limit on the number of requests generated using personal access tokens.

If you send more than five requests per second per base, you will receive a 429 error, indicating that you have sent too many requests. You will have to wait 30 seconds before resuming requests. This same limit applies for sending more than 50 requests across all bases per access token.

You can find out more in the [Airtable's rate limits documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/rate-limits). If you find yourself running into rate limits with the Airtable node, consider implementing one of the suggestions on the [handling rate limits](../../../rate-limits/) page.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
There was a problem loading the parameter options from server: "Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?"
```

## Code in n8n

**URL:** llms-txt#code-in-n8n

**Contents:**
- Code in your workflows
- Other technical resources
  - Technical nodes
  - Other developer resources

n8n is a low-code tool. This means you can do a lot without code, then add code when needed.

## Code in your workflows

There are two places in your workflows where you can use code:

Use [expressions](../glossary/#expression-n8n) to transform [data](../data/) in your nodes. You can use JavaScript in expressions, as well as n8n's [Built-in methods and variables](builtin/overview/) and [Data transformation functions](builtin/data-transformation-functions/).

[Expressions](expressions/)

Use the Code node to add JavaScript or Python to your workflow.

[Code node](code-node/)

## Other technical resources

These are features that are relevant to technical users.

n8n provides core nodes, which simplify adding key functionality such as API requests, webhooks, scheduling, and file handling.

- **Write a backend**

The [HTTP Request](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/), [Webhook](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/), and [Code](code-node/) nodes help you make API calls, respond to webhooks, and write any JavaScript in your workflow.

Use this do things like [Create an API endpoint](https://n8n.io/workflows/1750-creating-an-api-endpoint/).

[Core nodes](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/)

- **Represent complex logic**

You can build complex flows, using nodes like [If](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/), [Switch](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/), and [Merge](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) nodes.

[Flow logic](../flow-logic/)

### Other developer resources

n8n provides an API, where you can programmatically perform many of the same tasks as you can in the GUI. There's an [n8n API node](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8n/) to access the API in your workflows.

You can self-host n8n. This keeps your data on your own infrastructure.

[Hosting](../hosting/)

- **Build your own nodes**

You can build custom nodes, install them on your n8n instance, and publish them to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## Nodes

**URL:** llms-txt#nodes

**Contents:**
- Add a node to your workflow
  - Add a node to an empty workflow
  - Add a node to an existing workflow
- Node operations: Triggers and Actions
- Node controls
- Node settings

[Nodes](../../../glossary/#node-n8n) are the key building blocks of a [workflow](../../../glossary/#workflow-n8n). They perform a range of actions, including:

- Starting the workflow.
- Fetching and sending data.
- Processing and manipulating data.

n8n provides a collection of built-in nodes, as well as the ability to create your own nodes. Refer to:

- [Built-in integrations](../../../integrations/builtin/node-types/) to browse the node library.
- [Community nodes](../../../integrations/community-nodes/installation/) for guidance on finding and installing community-created nodes.
- [Creating nodes](../../../integrations/creating-nodes/overview/) to start building your own nodes.

## Add a node to your workflow

### Add a node to an empty workflow

1. Select **Add first step**. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse [trigger nodes](../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n).

1. Select the trigger you want to use.

Choose the correct app event

If you select **On App Event**, n8n shows a list of all the supported services. Use this list to browse n8n's integrations and trigger a workflow in response to an event in your chosen service. Not all integrations have triggers. To see which ones you can use as a trigger, select the node. If a trigger is available, you'll see it at the top of the available operations list.

For example, this is the trigger for Asana:

### Add a node to an existing workflow

Select the **Add node** connector. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse all nodes.

## Node operations: Triggers and Actions

When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.

There are two types of operation:

- Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon .
- Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected.

To view node controls, hover over the node on the canvas:

- **Execute step** : Run the node.
- **Deactivate** : Deactivate the node.
- **Delete** : Delete the node.
- **Node context menu** : Select node actions. Available actions:
  - Open node
  - Execute step
  - Rename node
  - Deactivate node
  - Pin node
  - Copy node
  - Duplicate node
  - Tidy up workflow
  - Convert node to sub-workflow
  - Select all
  - Clear selection
  - Delete node

The node settings under the **Settings** tab allow you to control node behaviors and add node notes.

When active or set, they do the following:

- **Always Output Data**: The node returns an empty item even if the node returns no data during execution. Be careful setting this on IF nodes, as it could cause an infinite loop.
- **Execute Once**: The node executes once, with data from the first item it receives. It doesn't process any extra items.
- **Retry On Fail**: When an execution fails, the node reruns until it succeeds.
- **On Error**:
  - **Stop Workflow**: Halts the entire workflow when an error occurs, preventing further node execution.
  - **Continue**: Proceeds to the next node despite the error, using the last valid data.
  - **Continue (using error output)**: Continues workflow execution, passing error information to the next node for potential handling.

You can document your workflow using node notes:

- **Notes**: Note to save with the node.
- **Display note in flow**: If active, n8n displays the note in the workflow as a subtitle.

---

## Data pinning

**URL:** llms-txt#data-pinning

**Contents:**
- Pin data
- Unpin data

You can 'pin' data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions.

You can use this when working with data from external sources to avoid having to repeat requests to the external system. This can save time and resources:

- If your workflow relies on an external system to trigger it, such as a webhook call, being able to pin data means you don't need to use the external system every time you test the workflow.
- If the external resource has data or usage limits, pinning data during tests avoids consuming your resource limits.
- You can fetch and pin the data you want to test, then have confidence that the data is consistent in all your workflow tests.

You can only pin data for nodes that have a single main output ("error" outputs don't count for this purpose).

Data pinning isn't available for production workflow executions. It's a feature to help test workflows during development.

To pin data in a node:

1. Run the node to load data.
1. In the **OUTPUT** view, select **Pin data** . When data pinning is active, the button is disabled and a "This data is pinned" banner is displayed in the **OUTPUT** view.

Nodes that output binary data

You can't pin data if the output data includes binary data.

When data pinning is active, a banner appears at the top of the node's output panel indicating that n8n has pinned the data. To unpin data and fetch fresh data on the next execution, select the **Unpin** link in the banner.

---

## All executions

**URL:** llms-txt#all-executions

**Contents:**
- Filter executions
- Retry failed workflows
- Load data from previous executions into your current workflow

To view **all executions** from an n8n instance, navigate to the **Overview** page and then click into the Executions tab. This will show you all executions from the workflows you have access to.

If your n8n instance supports **projects**, you'll also be able to view the executions tab within projects you have access to. This will show you executions only from the workflows within the specified project.

When you delete a workflow, n8n deletes its execution history as well. This means you can't view executions for deleted workflows.

You can filter the executions list:

1. Select the **Executions** tab either from within the **Overview** page or a specific **project** to open the list.
1. Select **Filters**.
1. Enter your filters. You can filter by:
   - **Workflows**: choose all workflows, or a specific workflow name.
   - **Status**: choose from **Failed**, **Running**, **Success**, or **Waiting**.
   - **Execution start**: see executions that started in the given time.
   - **Saved custom data**: this is data you create within the workflow using the Code node. Enter the key and value to filter. Refer to [Custom executions data](../custom-executions-data/) for information on adding custom data.

Custom executions data is available on:

- Cloud: Pro, Enterprise
- Self-Hosted: Enterprise, registered Community

## Retry failed workflows

If your workflow execution fails, you can retry the execution. To retry a failed workflow:

1. Select the **Executions** tab from within either the **Overview** page or a specific **project** to open the list.
1. On the execution you want to retry, select **Retry execution** .
1. Select either of the following options to retry the execution:
   - **Retry with currently saved workflow**: Once you make changes to your workflow, you can select this option to execute the workflow with the previous execution data.
   - **Retry with original workflow**: If you want to retry the execution without making changes to your workflow, you can select this option to retry the execution with the previous execution data.

## Load data from previous executions into your current workflow

You can load data from a previous workflow back into the canvas. Refer to [Debug executions](../debug/) for more information.

## Ollama Model node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#ollama-model-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Processing parameters
- Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance
- Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker
  - If only Ollama is in Docker
  - If only n8n is in Docker
  - If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers
  - If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container
- Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434
- Ollama and HTTP/HTTPS proxies

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Ollama Model node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters

The Ollama Model node is a [sub-node](../../../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n). Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including [root nodes](../../../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n), take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance

The Ollama Model node supports Bearer token authentication for connecting to remote Ollama instances behind authenticated proxies (such as Open WebUI).

For remote authenticated connections, configure both the remote URL and API key in your Ollama credentials.

Follow the [Ollama credentials instructions](../../../../credentials/ollama/) for more information.

## Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker

The Ollama Model node connects to a locally hosted Ollama instance using the base URL defined by [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/). When you run either n8n or Ollama in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Ollama.

Ollama typically listens for connections on `localhost`, the local network address. In Docker, by default, each container has its own `localhost` which is only accessible from within the container. If either n8n or Ollama are running in containers, they won't be able to connect over `localhost`.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only Ollama is in Docker

If only Ollama is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the ports](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, Ollama runs on port 11434, so your Docker command should look like this:

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **base URL** to `http://localhost:11434`).

### If only n8n is in Docker

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), use `host.docker.internal` as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, to bind to the default port 11434, you could set the base URL to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers

If both n8n and Ollama are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), use the Ollama container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the Ollama container `my-ollama` and it listens on the default port 11434, you would set the base URL to `http://my-ollama:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container

If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure Ollama to listen on localhost and configure the base URL in the [Ollama credentials in n8n](../../../../credentials/ollama/) to use localhost: `http://localhost:11434`.

## Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434

This error occurs when your computer has IPv6 enabled, but Ollama is listening to an IPv4 address.

To fix this, change the base URL in your [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/) to connect to `127.0.0.1`, the IPv4-specific local address, instead of the `localhost` alias that can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`.

## Ollama and HTTP/HTTPS proxies

Ollama doesn't support custom HTTP agents in its configuration. This makes it difficult to use Ollama behind custom HTTP/HTTPS proxies. Depending on your proxy configuration, it might not work at all, despite setting the `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.

Refer to [Ollama's FAQ](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-do-i-use-ollama-behind-a-proxy) for more information.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

## Postgres Chat Memory node

**URL:** llms-txt#postgres-chat-memory-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
- Related resources
- Single memory instance

Use the Postgres Chat Memory node to use Postgres as a [memory](../../../../../glossary/#ai-memory) server for storing chat history.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Postgres Chat Memory node supports, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/postgres/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Session Key**: Enter the key to use to store the memory in the workflow data.
- **Table Name**: Enter the name of the table to store the chat history in. The system will create the table if doesn't exist.
- **Context Window Length**: Enter the number of previous interactions to consider for context.

Refer to [LangChain's Postgres Chat Message History documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/memory/postgres) for more information about the service.

View n8n's [Advanced AI](../../../../../advanced-ai/) documentation.

## Single memory instance

If you add more than one Postgres Chat Memory node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](../n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.

## Using the n8n-node tool

**URL:** llms-txt#using-the-n8n-node-tool

**Contents:**
- Get n8n-node
  - Run n8n-node without installing
  - Install n8n-node globally
- Command overview
  - new
  - build
  - dev
  - lint
  - release
- Creating a new node

The `n8n-node` tool is the official CLI for developing community nodes for n8n. You can use it to scaffold out new nodes, build your projects, and run your node as you develop it.

Using `n8n-node`, you can create nodes that adhere to the [guidelines for verified community nodes](../reference/verification-guidelines/).

### Run n8n-node without installing

You can create an `n8n-node` project directly without installing by using the [`@n8n/create-node` initializer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/create-node) with your package manager:

This sets up the initial project files locally (an alternative to installing `n8n-node` locally and explicitly running the [`new` command](#new)). Afterward, you run the rest of the `n8n-node` commands through your package manager's script runner inside the project directory (for example, `npm run dev`).

### Install n8n-node globally

You can install `n8n-node` globally with `npm`:

Verify access to the command by typing:

The `n8n-node` tool provides the following commands:

The `new` command creates the file system structure and metadata for a new node. This command initializes the same structure as outlined in [run n8n-node without installing](#run-n8n-node-without-installing).

When called, it interactively prompts for details about your project to customize your starting code. You'll provide the project name, choose a node type, and select the starting template that best matches your needs. The `n8n-node` tool will create your project file structure and optionally install your initial project dependencies.

Learn more about how to use the `new` command in the [creating a new node section](#creating-a-new-node).

The `build` command compiles your node and copies all the required assets.

Learn more about how to use the `build` command in the [building your node section](#building-your-node).

The `dev` command runs n8n with your node. It monitors your project directory and automatically rebuilds the live preview when it detects changes.

Learn more about how to use the `dev` command in the [testing your node in n8n section](#testing-your-node-in-n8n).

The `lint` command checks the code for the node in the current directory. You can optionally use with the `--fix` option to attempt to automatically fix any issues it identifies.

Learn more about how to use the `lint` command in the [lint your node section](#lint-your-node).

The `release` command publishes your community node package to npm. It uses [`release-it`](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) to clean, check and cleanly build your package before publishing it to npm.

Learn more about how to use the `release` command in the [release your node section](#release-your-node).

## Creating a new node

To create a new node with `n8n-node`, call `n8n-node new`. You can call this command entirely interactively or provide details on the command line.

Create new node without installing

You can optionally create an `n8n-node` project directly without installing `n8n-node` by using the [`@n8n/create-node` initializer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/create-node) with your package manager.

In the commands below, substitute `n8n-node new` with `npm create @n8n/node@latest`. When using this form, you must add a double dash (`--`) before including any options (like `--template`). For example:

The command will prompt for any missing information about your node and then generate a project structure to get you started. By default, it will follow up by installing the initial project dependencies (you can disable this by passing the `--skip-install` flag).

### Setting node details interactively

When called without arguments, `n8n-node new` prompts you for details about your new node interactively:

This will start an interactive prompt where you can define the details of your project:

- **What is your node called?** The name of your node. This impacts the name of your project directory, package name, and the n8n node itself. The name must use one of the following formats:
  - `n8n-nodes-<YOUR_NODE_NAME>`
  - `@<YOUR_ORG>/n8n-nodes-<YOUR_NODE_NAME>`
- **What kind of node are you building?** The [node type](../../plan/choose-node-method/) you want to build:
  - **HTTP API**: A low-code, declarative node structure that's designed for faster approval for n8n Cloud.
  - **Other**: A programmatic style node with full flexibility.
- **What template do you want to use?** When using the HTTP API, you can choose the template to start from:
  - **GitHub Issues API**: A demo node that includes multiple operations and credentials. This can help you get familiar with the node structure and conventions.
  - **Start from scratch**: A blank template that will guide you through your custom setup with some further prompts.

When choosing HTTP API > Start from scratch, `n8n-node` will ask you the following:

- **What's the base URL of the API?** The root URL for the API you plan to integrate with.
- **What type of authentication does your API use?** The authentication your node should provide:
  - **API Key**: Send a secret key using headers, query parameters, or the request body.
  - **Bearer Token**: Send a token using the Authorization header (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
  - **OAuth2**: Use an OAuth 2.0 flow to get access tokens on behalf of a user or app.
  - **Basic Auth**: Send the base64-encoded username and password through Authorization headers.
  - **Custom**: Create your own credential logic. This will create an empty credential class that you can customize according to your needs.
  - **None**: No authentication necessary. Don't create a credential class for the node.

Once you've made your selections, `n8n-node` will create a new project directory for your node in the current directory. By default, it will also install the initial project dependencies (you can disable this by passing the `--skip-install` flag).

### Providing node details on the command line

You can provide some of your node details on the command line to avoid prompts.

You can include the name you want to use for your node an argument:

Node names must use one of the following formats:

- `@<YOUR_ORG>/n8n-nodes-<YOUR_NODE_NAME>`
- `n8n-nodes-<YOUR_NODE_NAME>`

If you know the template you want to use ahead of time, you can also pass the value using the `--template` flag:

The template must be one of the following:

- `declarative/github-issues`: A demo node that includes multiple operations and credentials. This can help you get familiar with the node structure and conventions.
- `declarative/custom`: A blank template that will guide you through your custom setup with some further prompts.
- `programmatic/example`: A programmatic style node with full flexibility.

## Building your node

You can build your node by running the `build` command in your project's root directory:

`n8n-node` will compile your TypeScript files and bundle your other project assets. You can also call the `build` script from your package manager. For instance, if you're using `npm`, this works the same:

The `n8n-node` tool automatically creates a `lint` script for your project as well. You can run with your package manager. For example:

You can also run through your package manager's script runner:

If you include the `--fix` option (also callable with `npm run lint:fix`), `n8n-node` will attempt to fix the issues that it identifies:

## Testing your node in n8n

To test your node in n8n, you run the `dev` command in your project's root directory:

As with the `build` command, you can also run this through your package manager. For example:

`n8n-node` will compile your project and then start up a local n8n instance through `npm` with your node loaded.

Visit your `localhost:5678` to sign in to your n8n instance. If you open a workflow, your node appears in the nodes panel:

From there, you can add it to your workflow and test the node's functionality as you develop.

To publish your node, run the `release` command in your project directory. This command uses [`release-it`](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) to build and publish your node.

To use the `release` command, you must log in to npm using `npm login` command. Without this, `n8n-node` won't have authorization to publish your project files.

To run with `npm`, type:

When you run the `release` command, `n8n-node` will perform the following actions:

- build the node
- run lint checks against your files
- update the changelog
- create git tags
- create a GitHub release
- publish the package to npm

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
npm create @n8n/node@latest
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
npm install --global @n8n/node-cli
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
n8n-node --version
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
npm create @n8n/node@latest n8n-nodes-mynode -- --template declarative/custom
```

## Mapping in the UI

**URL:** llms-txt#mapping-in-the-ui

**Contents:**
- How to drag and drop data
  - Understand what you're mapping with drag and drop
  - Understand nested data

Data mapping means referencing data from previous nodes. It doesn't include changing (transforming) data, just referencing it.

You can map data in the following ways:

- Using the expressions editor.
- By dragging and dropping data from the **INPUT** into parameters. This generates the expression for you.

For information on errors with mapping and linking items, refer to [Item linking errors](../data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/).

## How to drag and drop data

1. Run your workflow to load data.
1. Open the node where you need to map data.
1. You can map in table, JSON, and schema view:
   - In table view: click and hold a table heading to map top level data, or a field in the table to map nested data.
   - In JSON view: click and hold a key.
   - In schema view: click and hold a key.
1. Drag the item into the field where you want to use the data.

### Understand what you're mapping with drag and drop

Data mapping maps the key path, and loads the key's value into the field. For example, given the following data:

You can map `fruit` by dragging and dropping **fruit** from the **INPUT** into the field where you want to use its value. This creates an expression, `{{ $json.fruit }}`. When the node iterates over input items, the value of the field becomes the value of `fruit` for each item.

### Understand nested data

Given the following data:

n8n displays it in table form like this:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
[
	{
		"fruit": "apples",
		"color": "green"
	}
]
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
[
  {
    "name": "First item",
    "nested": {
      "example-number-field": 1,
      "example-string-field": "apples"
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "Second item",
    "nested": {
      "example-number-field": 2,
      "example-string-field": "oranges"
    }
  }
]
```

## Call an API to fetch data

**URL:** llms-txt#call-an-api-to-fetch-data

**Contents:**
- Key features
- Using the example

Use n8n to bring data from any [API](../../../glossary/#api) to your AI. This workflow uses the [Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) to provide the chat interface, and the [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) to call a second workflow that calls the API. The second workflow uses AI functionality to refine the API request based on the user's query.

[View workflow file](/_workflows/advanced-ai/examples/let_your_ai_call_an_api.json)

- [Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/): start your workflow and respond to user chat interactions. The node provides a customizable chat interface.
- [Agent](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): the key piece of the AI workflow. The Agent interacts with other components of the workflow and makes decisions about what tools to use.
- [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/): plug in n8n workflows as custom tools. In AI, a tool is an interface the AI can use to interact with the world (in this case, the data provided by your workflow). The AI model uses the tool to access information beyond its built-in dataset.
- A [Basic LLM Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/) with an [Auto-fixing Output Parser](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/) and [Structured Output Parser](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/) to read the user's query and set parameters for the API call based on the user input.

To load the template into your n8n instance:

1. Download the workflow JSON file.
1. Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.
1. Copy in the JSON, or select **Workflow menu** > **Import from file...**.

The example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:

- Yellow: notes and information.
- Green: instructions to run the workflow.
- Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.
- Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example.

  - Poll Times
  - Base
  - Table
  - Trigger Field
  - Download Attachments
  - Download Fields
  - Additional Fields

[Airtable](https://airtable.com/) is a spreadsheet-database hybrid, with the features of a database but applied to a spreadsheet. The fields in an Airtable table are similar to cells in a spreadsheet, but have types such as 'checkbox', 'phone number', and 'drop-down list', and can reference file attachments like images.

On this page, you'll find a list of events the Airtable Trigger node can respond to and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/airtable/).

- **New Airtable event**

n8n provides an app node for Airtable. You can find the node docs [here](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/).

View [example workflows and related content](https://n8n.io/integrations/airtable-trigger/) on n8n's website.

Refer to [Airtable's documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction) for details about their API.

Use these parameters to configure your node.

n8n's Airtable node uses polling for check for updates on configured Airtable resources. The **Poll Times** parameter configures the querying frequency:

- Every Minute
- Every Hour
- Every Day
- Every Week
- Every Month
- Every X: Check for updates every given number of minutes or hours.
- Custom: Customize the polling interval by providing a [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).

Use the **Add Poll Time** button to add more polling intervals.

The [Airtable base](https://support.airtable.com/docs/airtable-bases-overview) you want to check for updates on. You can provide your base's URL or [base ID](https://support.airtable.com/docs/finding-airtable-ids#finding-base-table-and-view-ids-from-urls).

The [Airtable table](https://support.airtable.com/docs/tables-overview) within the Airtable base that you want to check for updates on. You can provide the table's URL or [table ID](https://support.airtable.com/docs/finding-airtable-ids#finding-base-table-and-view-ids-from-urls).

A created or last modified field in your table. The Airtable Trigger node uses this to determine what updates occurred since the previous check.

### Download Attachments

Whether to download attachments from the table. When enabled, the **Download Fields** parameter defines the attachment fields.

When you enable the **Download Attachments** toggle, this field defines which table fields to download. Field names are case sensitive. Use a comma to separate multiple field names.

### Additional Fields

Use the **Add Field** button to add the following parameters:

- **Fields**: A comma-separated list of fields to include in the output. If you don't specify anything here, the output will contain only the **Trigger Field**.
- **Formula**: An [Airtable formula](https://support.airtable.com/docs/formula-field-reference) to further filter the results. You can use this to add further constraints to the events that trigger the workflow. Note that formula values aren't taken into account for manual executions, only for production polling.
- **View ID**: The name or ID of a table view. When defined, only returns records available in the given view.

## Embeddings Google Vertex node

**URL:** llms-txt#embeddings-google-vertex-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

Use the Embeddings Google Vertex node to generate [embeddings](../../../../../glossary/#ai-embedding) for a given text.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings Google Vertex node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/google/service-account/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Model**: Select the model to use to generate the embedding.

## Structure of the node base file

**URL:** llms-txt#structure-of-the-node-base-file

**Contents:**
- Outline structure for a declarative-style node
- Outline structure for a programmatic-style node

The node base file follows this basic structure:

1. Add import statements.
1. Create a class for the node.
1. Within the node class, create a `description` object, which defines the node.

A programmatic-style node also has an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the `routing` key in the `properties` object, within `descriptions`.

## Outline structure for a declarative-style node

This code snippet gives an outline of the node structure.

Refer to [Standard parameters](../standard-parameters/) for information on parameters available to all node types. Refer to [Declarative-style parameters](../declarative-style-parameters/) for the parameters available for declarative-style nodes.

## Outline structure for a programmatic-style node

This code snippet gives an outline of the node structure.

Refer to [Standard parameters](../standard-parameters/) for information on parameters available to all node types. Refer to [Programmatic-style parameters](../programmatic-style-parameters/) and [Programmatic-style execute method](../programmatic-style-execute-method/) for more information on working with programmatic-style nodes.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
import { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';

export class ExampleNode implements INodeType {
	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
		// Basic node details here
		properties: [
			// Resources and operations here
		]
	};
}
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
import { IExecuteFunctions } from 'n8n-core';
import { INodeExecutionData, INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';

export class ExampleNode implements INodeType {
	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    // Basic node details here
    properties: [
      // Resources and operations here
    ]
  };

  async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {

  - String
  - Number
  - Date & Time
  - Boolean

Use the Switch node to route a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations. It's similar to the [IF](../n8n-nodes-base.if/) node, but supports multiple output routes.

Select the **Mode** the node should use:

- **Rules**: Select this mode to build a matching rule for each output.
- **Expression**: Select this mode to write an expression to return the output index programmatically.

Node configuration depends on the **Mode** you select.

To configure the node with this operation, use these parameters:

- Create **Routing Rules** to define comparison conditions.
  - Use the data type dropdown to select the data type and comparison operation type for your condition. For example, to create a rules for dates after a particular date, select **Date & Time > is after**.
  - The fields and values to enter into the condition change based on the data type and comparison you select. Refer to [Available data type comparisons](#available-data-type-comparisons) for a full list of all comparisons by data type.
- **Rename Output**: Turn this control on to rename the output field to put matching data into. Enter your desired **Output Name**.

Select **Add Routing Rule** to add more rules.

You can further configure the node with this operation using these **Options**:

- **Fallback Output**: Choose how to route the workflow when an item doesn't match any of the rules or conditions.
  - **None**: Ignore the item. This is the default behavior.
  - **Extra Output**: Send items to an extra, separate output.
  - **Output 0**: Send items to the same output as those matching the first rule.
- **Ignore Case**: Set whether to ignore letter case when evaluating conditions (turned on) or enforce letter case (turned off).
- **Less Strict Type Validation**: Set whether you want n8n to attempt to convert value types based on the operator you choose (turned on) or not (turned off).
- **Send data to all matching outputs**: Set whether to send data to all outputs meeting conditions (turned on) or whether to send the data to the first output matching the conditions (turned off).

To configure the node with this operation, use these parameters:

- **Number of Outputs**: Set how many outputs the node should have.
- **Output Index**: Create an expression to calculate which input item should be routed to which output. The expression must return a number.

Refer to [WhatsApp's documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api) for details about their API.

Here are some common errors and issues with the WhatsApp Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Workflow only works in testing or production

WhatsApp only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), WhatsApp overwrites the registered webhook URL.

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. WhatsApp will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:

Halts production traffic

This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.

1. Go to your workflow page.
1. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
1. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
1. When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

## 7. Scheduling the Workflow

**URL:** llms-txt#7.-scheduling-the-workflow

**Contents:**
- Remove the Manual Trigger node
- Add the Schedule Trigger node
- Connect the Schedule Trigger node
- What's next?

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to schedule your workflow so that it runs automatically at a set time/interval using the Schedule Trigger node. After this step, your workflow should look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/finished.json)

The workflow you've built so far executes only when you click on **Execute Workflow**. But Nathan needs it to run automatically every Monday morning. You can do this with the [Schedule Trigger](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/), which allows you to schedule workflows to run periodically at fixed dates, times, or intervals.

To achieve this, we'll remove the Manual Trigger node we started with and replace it with a Schedule Trigger node instead.

## Remove the Manual Trigger node

First, let's remove the Manual Trigger node:

1. Select the Manual Trigger node connected to your HTTP Request node.
1. Select the trash can icon to delete.

This removes the Manual Trigger node and you'll see an "Add first step" option.

## Add the Schedule Trigger node

1. Open the nodes panel and search for **Schedule Trigger**.
1. Select it when it appears in the search results.

In the Schedule Trigger node window, configure these parameters:

- **Trigger Interval**: Select **Weeks**.
- **Weeks Between Triggers**: Enter `1`.
- **Trigger on weekdays**: Select **Monday** (and remove **Sunday** if added by default).
- **Trigger at Hour**: Select **9am**.
- **Trigger at Minute**: Enter `0`.

Your Schedule Trigger node should look like this:

*Schedule Trigger Node*

To ensure accurate scheduling with the Schedule Trigger node, be sure to set the correct timezone for your [n8n instance](../../../../manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/) or the [workflow's settings](../../../../workflows/settings/). The Schedule Trigger node will use the workflow's timezone if it's set; it will fall back to the n8n instance's timezone if it's not.

## Connect the Schedule Trigger node

Return to the canvas and connect your Schedule Trigger node to the HTTP Request node by dragging the arrow from it to the HTTP Request node.

Your full workflow should look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/finished.json)

**You 👩‍🔧**: That was it for the workflow! I've added and configured all necessary nodes. Now every time you click on **Execute workflow**, n8n will execute all the nodes: getting, filtering, calculating, and transferring the sales data.

**Nathan 🙋**: This is just what I needed! My workflow will run automatically every Monday morning, correct?

**You 👩‍🔧**: Not so fast. To do that, you need to activate your workflow. I'll do this in the next step and show you how to interpret the execution log.

## Execute Command node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#execute-command-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Command failed: <command> /bin/sh: <command>: not found
- Error: stdout maxBuffer length exceeded

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Execute Command node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Command failed: <command> /bin/sh: <command>: not found

This error occurs when the shell environment can't find one of the commands in the **Command** parameter.

To fix this error, review the following:

- Check that the command and its arguments don't have typos in the **Command** parameter.
- Check that the command is in the `PATH` of the user running n8n.
- If you are running n8n with Docker, check if the command is available within the container by trying to run it manually. If your command isn't included in the container, you might have to extend the official n8n image with a [custom image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/) that includes your command.
  - If n8n is already running:

- If n8n isn't running:

## Error: stdout maxBuffer length exceeded

This error happens when your command returns more output than the Execute Command node is able to process at one time.

To avoid this error, reduce output your command produces. Check your command's manual page or documentation to see if there are flags to limit or filter output. If not, you may need to pipe the output to another command to remove unneeded info.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
# Find n8n's container ID, it will be the first column
    docker ps | grep n8n
    # Try to execute the command within the running container
    docker container exec <container_ID> <command_to_run>
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
# Start up a new container that runs the command instead of n8n
    # Use the same image and tag that you use to run n8n normally
    docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/sh docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n -c <command_to_run>
```

## LangChain concepts in n8n

**URL:** llms-txt#langchain-concepts-in-n8n

**Contents:**
- Trigger nodes
- Cluster nodes
  - Root nodes
  - Sub-nodes

This page explains how LangChain concepts and features map to n8n nodes.

This page includes lists of the LangChain-focused nodes in n8n. You can use any n8n node in a workflow where you interact with LangChain, to link LangChain to other services. The LangChain features uses n8n's [Cluster nodes](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/).

n8n implements LangChain JS

This feature is n8n's implementation of [LangChain's JavaScript framework](https://js.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction).

[Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/)

[Cluster nodes](../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

Each cluster starts with one [root node](../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n).

A [chain](../../../glossary/#ai-chain) is a series of LLMs, and related tools, linked together to support functionality that can't be provided by a single LLM alone.

- [Basic LLM Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/)
- [Retrieval Q&A Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/)
- [Summarization Chain](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainsummarization/)
- [Sentiment Analysis](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.sentimentanalysis/)
- [Text Classifier](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.text-classifier/)

Learn more about [chaining in LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/lcel).

[LangChain Code](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.code/): import LangChain. This means if there is functionality you need that n8n hasn't created a node for, you can still use it.

Each root node can have one or more [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) attached to it.

#### Document loaders

Document loaders add data to your chain as documents. The data source can be a file or web service.

## Structured Output Parser node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#structured-output-parser-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Processing parameters
- Adding the structured output parser node to AI nodes
- Using the structured output parser to format intermediary steps
- Structuring output from agents

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Structured Output Parser node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters

The Structured Output Parser node is a [sub-node](../../../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n). Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including [root nodes](../../../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n), take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Adding the structured output parser node to AI nodes

You can attach output parser nodes to select [AI root nodes](../../../root-nodes/).

To add the Structured Output Parser to a node, enable the **Require Specific Output Format** option in the AI root node you wish to format. Once the option is enabled, a new **output parser** attachment point is displayed. Click the **output parser** attachment point to add the Structured Output Parser node to the node.

## Using the structured output parser to format intermediary steps

The Structured Output Parser node structures the final output from AI agents. It's not intended to structure intermediary output to pass to other AI tools or stages.

To request a specific format for intermediary output, include the response structure in the **System Message** for the **AI Agent**. The message can include either a schema or example response for the agent to use as a template for its results.

## Structuring output from agents

Structured output parsing is often not reliable when working with [agents](../../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/).

If your workflow uses agents, n8n recommends using a separate [LLM-chain](../../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/) to receive the data from the agent and parse it. This leads to better, more consistent results than parsing directly in the agent workflow.

## External storage

**URL:** llms-txt#external-storage

**Contents:**
- Storing n8n's binary data in S3
  - Setup
  - Usage

- Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans
- If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa).

n8n can store binary data produced by workflow executions externally. This feature is useful to avoid relying on the filesystem for storing large amounts of binary data.

n8n will introduce external storage for other data types in the future.

## Storing n8n's binary data in S3

n8n supports [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) as an external store for binary data produced by workflow executions. You can use other S3-compatible services like Cloudflare R2 and Backblaze B2, but n8n doesn't officially support these.

Enterprise-tier feature

You will need an [Enterprise license key](../../../license-key/) for external storage. If your license key expires and you remain on S3 mode, the instance will be able to read from, but not write to, the S3 bucket.

Create and configure a bucket following the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html). You can use the following policy, replacing `<bucket-name>` with the name of the bucket you created:

Set a bucket-level lifecycle configuration so that S3 automatically deletes old binary data. n8n delegates pruning of binary data to S3, so setting a lifecycle configuration is required unless you want to preserve binary data indefinitely.

Once you finish creating the bucket, you will have a host, bucket name and region, and an access key ID and secret access key. You need to set them in n8n's environment:

If your provider doesn't require a region, you can set `N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_REGION` to `'auto'`.

Tell n8n to store binary data in S3:

To automatically detect credentials to authenticate your S3 calls, set `N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_AUTH_AUTO_DETECT` to `true`. This will use the default [credential provider chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html#credchain).

Restart the server to load the new configuration.

After you enable S3, n8n writes and reads any new binary data to and from the S3 bucket. n8n writes binary data to your S3 bucket in this format:

n8n continues to read older binary data stored in the filesystem from the filesystem, if `filesystem` remains listed as an option in `N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES`.

If you store binary data in S3 and later switch to filesystem mode, the instance continues to read any data stored in S3, as long as `s3` remains listed in `N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES` and your S3 credentials remain valid.

Binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. This may change in future.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
{
 "Version": "2012-10-17",

  {

## Workflow 1: Merging data

**URL:** llms-txt#workflow-1:-merging-data

Nathan's company stores its customer data in Airtable. This data contains information about the customers' ID, country, email, and join date, but lacks data about their respective region and subregion. You need to fill in these last two fields in order to create the reports for regional sales.

To accomplish this task, you first need to make a copy of this table in your Airtable account:

When setting up your Airtable, ensure that the `customerSince` column is configured as a Date type field with the **Include time** option enabled. Without this setting, you may encounter errors in step 4 when updating the table.

Next, build a small workflow that merges data from Airtable and a REST Countries API:

1. Use the [**Airtable node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/) to list the data in the Airtable table named `customers`.
1. Use the [**HTTP Request node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to get data from the REST Countries API: `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all`, and send the query parameter name `fields` with the value `name,region,subregion`. This will return data about world countries, split out into separate items.
1. Use the [**Merge node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) to merge data from Airtable and the Countries API by country name, represented as `customerCountry` in Airtable and `name.common` in the Countries API, respectively.
1. Use another Airtable node to update the fields `region` and `subregion` in Airtable with the data from the Countries API.

The workflow should look like this:

*Workflow 1 for merging data from Airtable and the Countries API*

- How many items does the **HTTP Request node** return?
- How many items does the **Merge node** return?
- How many unique regions are assigned in the customers table?
- What's the subregion assigned to the customerID 10?

## Merging data

**URL:** llms-txt#merging-data

**Contents:**
- Merge data from different data streams
- Merge data from different nodes
- Merge data from multiple node executions
- Compare, merge, and split again

Merging brings multiple data streams together. You can achieve this using different nodes depending on your workflow requirements.

- Merge data from different data streams or nodes: Use the [Merge](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) node to combine data from various sources into one.
- Merge data from multiple node executions: Use the [Code](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node for complex scenarios where you need to merge data from multiple executions of a node or multiple nodes.
- Compare and merge data: Use the [Compare Datasets](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/) node to compare, merge, and output data streams based on the comparison.

Explore each method in more detail in the sections below.

## Merge data from different data streams

If your workflow [splits](../splitting/), you combine the separate streams back into one stream.

Here's an [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1747-joining-different-datasets/) showing different types of merging: appending data sets, keeping only new items, and keeping only existing items. The [Merge node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) documentation contains details on each of the merge operations.

[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1747-joining-different-datasets/)

## Merge data from different nodes

You can use the Merge node to combine data from two previous nodes, even if the workflow hasn't split into separate data streams. This can be useful if you want to generate a single dataset from the data generated by multiple nodes.

Merging data from two previous nodes

## Merge data from multiple node executions

Use the Code node to merge data from multiple node executions. This is useful in some [Looping](../looping/) scenarios.

Node executions and workflow executions

This section describes merging data from multiple node executions. This is when a node executes multiple times during a single workflow execution.

Refer to this [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1814-merge-multiple-runs-into-one/) using Loop Over Items and Wait to artificially create multiple executions.

[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/1814-merge-multiple-runs-into-one/)

## Compare, merge, and split again

The [Compare Datasets](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/) node compares data streams before merging them. It outputs up to four different data streams.

Refer to this [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1943-comparing-data-with-the-compare-datasets-node/) for an example.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Model**: Select the model to use to generate the embedding.

## Memory-related errors

**URL:** llms-txt#memory-related-errors

**Contents:**
- Identifying out of memory situations
- Typical causes
- Avoiding out of memory situations
  - Increase available memory
  - Reduce memory consumption
  - Increase old memory

n8n doesn't restrict the amount of data each node can fetch and process. While this gives you freedom, it can lead to errors when workflow executions require more memory than available. This page explains how to identify and avoid these errors.

Only for self-hosted n8n

This page describes memory-related errors when [self-hosting n8n](../../). Visit [Cloud data management](../../../manage-cloud/cloud-data-management/) to learn about memory limits for [n8n Cloud](../../../manage-cloud/overview/).

## Identifying out of memory situations

n8n provides error messages that warn you in some out of memory situations. For example, messages such as **Execution stopped at this node (n8n may have run out of memory while executing it)**.

Error messages including **Problem running workflow**, **Connection Lost**, or **503 Service Temporarily Unavailable** suggest that an n8n instance has become unavailable.

When self-hosting n8n, you may also see error messages such as **Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory** in your server logs.

On n8n Cloud, or when using n8n's Docker image, n8n restarts automatically when encountering such an issue. However, when running n8n with npm you might need to restart it manually.

Such problems occur when a workflow execution requires more memory than available to an n8n instance. Factors increasing the memory usage for a workflow execution include:

- Amount of [JSON data](../../../data/data-structure/).
- Size of binary data.
- Number of nodes in a workflow.
- Some nodes are memory-heavy: the [Code](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node and the older Function node can increase memory consumption significantly.
- Manual or automatic workflow executions: manual executions increase memory consumption as n8n makes a copy of the data for the frontend.
- Additional workflows running at the same time.

## Avoiding out of memory situations

When encountering an out of memory situation, there are two options: either increase the amount of memory available to n8n or reduce the memory consumption.

### Increase available memory

When self-hosting n8n, increasing the amount of memory available to n8n means provisioning your n8n instance with more memory. This may incur additional costs with your hosting provider.

On n8n cloud you need to upgrade to a larger plan.

### Reduce memory consumption

This approach is more complex and means re-building the workflows causing the issue. This section provides some guidelines on how to reduce memory consumption. Not all suggestions are applicable to all workflows.

- Split the data processed into smaller chunks. For example, instead of fetching 10,000 rows with each execution, process 200 rows with each execution.
- Avoid using the Code node where possible.
- Avoid manual executions when processing larger amounts of data.
- Split the workflow up into sub-workflows and ensure each sub-workflow returns a limited amount of data to its parent workflow.

Splitting the workflow might seem counter-intuitive at first as it usually requires adding at least two more nodes: the [Loop Over Items](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to split up the items into smaller batches and the [Execute Workflow](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node to start the sub-workflow.

However, as long as your sub-workflow does the heavy lifting for each batch and then returns only a small result set to the main workflow, this reduces memory consumption. This is because the sub-workflow only holds the data for the current batch in memory, after which the memory is free again.

### Increase old memory

This applies to self-hosting n8n. When encountering **JavaScript heap out of memory** errors, it's often useful to allocate additional memory to the old memory section of the V8 JavaScript engine. To do this, set the appropriate [V8 option](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-old-space-sizesize-in-megabytes) `--max-old-space-size=SIZE` either through the CLI or through the `NODE_OPTIONS` [environment variable](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#node_optionsoptions).

## Block access to nodes

**URL:** llms-txt#block-access-to-nodes

**Contents:**
- Exclude nodes
- Suggested nodes to block
- Related resources

For security reasons, you may want to block your users from accessing or working with specific n8n nodes. This is helpful if your users might be untrustworthy.

Use the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable to prevent your users from accessing specific nodes.

Update your `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable to include an array of strings containing any nodes you want to block your users from using.

For example, setting the variable this way:

Blocks the [Execute Command](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/) and [Read/Write Files from Disk](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) nodes.

Your n8n users won't be able to search for or use these nodes.

## Suggested nodes to block

The nodes that can pose security risks vary based on your use case and user profile. Here are some nodes you might want to start with:

- [Execute Command](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executecommand/)
- [Read/Write Files from Disk](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)

Refer to [Nodes environment variables](../../configuration/environment-variables/nodes/) for more information on this environment variable.

Refer to [Configuration](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on setting environment variables.

  - Set up the credential
- Using OAuth2

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [GitHub](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.github/)
- [GitHub Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.githubtrigger/)
- [GitHub Document Loader](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentgithubloader/): this node doesn't support OAuth.

Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

## Supported authentication methods

- API access token: Use this method with any GitHub nodes.
- OAuth2: Use this method with [GitHub](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.github/) and [GitHub Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.githubtrigger/) nodes only; don't use with [GitHub Document Loader](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentgithubloader/).

Refer to [GitHub's API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) for more information about the service.

## Using API access token

To configure this credential, you'll need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

There are two steps to setting up this credential:

1. [Generate a GitHub personal access token](#generate-personal-access-token).
1. [Set up the credential](#set-up-the-credential).

Refer to the sections below for detailed instructions.

### Generate personal access token

Recommended access token type

n8n recommends using a personal access token (classic). GitHub's fine-grained personal access tokens are still in beta and can't access all endpoints.

To generate your personal access token:

1. If you haven't done so already, verify your email address with GitHub. Refer to [Verifying your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address) for more information.
1. Open your GitHub profile [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile).
1. In the left navigation, select [**Developer settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps).
1. In the left navigation, under **Personal access tokens**, select **Tokens (classic)**.
1. Select **Generate new token > Generate new token (classic)**.
1. Enter a descriptive name for your token in the **Note** field, like `n8n integration`.
1. Select the **Expiration** you'd like for the token, or select **No expiration**.
1. Select **Scopes** for your token. For most of the n8n GitHub nodes, add the `repo` scope.
   - A token without assigned scopes can only access public information.
   - Refer to
1. Select **Generate token**.
1. Copy the token.

Refer to [Creating a personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) for more information. Refer to [Scopes for OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes) for more information on GitHub scopes.

### Set up the credential

Then, in your n8n credential:

1. If you aren't using GitHub Enterprise Server, don't change the **GitHub server** URL.
   - If you're using [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server), update **GitHub server** to match the URL for your server.
1. Enter your **User** name as it appears in your GitHub profile.
1. Enter the **Access Token** you generated above.

Note for n8n Cloud users

Cloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.

If you're [self-hosting n8n](../../../../hosting/), create a new GitHub [OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps):

1. Open your GitHub profile [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile).
1. In the left navigation, select [**Developer settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps).
1. In the left navigation, select **OAuth apps**.
1. Select **New OAuth App**.
   - If you haven't created an app before, you may see **Register a new application** instead. Select it.
1. Enter an **Application name**, like `n8n integration`.
1. Enter the **Homepage URL** for your app's website.
1. If you'd like, add the optional **Application description**, which GitHub displays to end-users.
1. From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and paste it into the GitHub **Authorization callback URL**.
1. Select **Register application**.
1. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** this generates and add them to your n8n credential.

Refer to the [GitHub Authorizing OAuth apps documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps) for more information on the authorization process.

## Text Classifier node

**URL:** llms-txt#text-classifier-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
- Node options
- Related resources

Use the Text Classifier node to classify (categorize) incoming data. Using the categories provided in the parameters (see below), each item is passed to the model to determine its category.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Text Classifier node, and links to more resources.

- **Input Prompt** defines the input to classify. This is usually an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be `{{ $json.chatInput }}` if the input is a chat trigger. By default it references the `text` field.
- **Categories**: Add the categories that you want to classify your input as. Categories have a name and a description. Use the description to tell the model what the category means. This is important if the meaning isn't obvious. You can add as many categories as you like.

- **Allow Multiple Classes To Be True**: You can configure the classifier to always output a single class per item (turned off), or allow the model to select multiple classes (turned on).
- **When No Clear Match**: Define what happens if the model can't find a good match for an item. There are two options:
  - **Discard Item** (the default): If the node doesn't detect any of the categories, it drops the item.
  - **Output on Extra, 'Other' Branch**: Creates a separate output branch called **Other**. When the node doesn't detect any of the categories, it outputs items in this branch.
- **System Prompt Template**: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the classification. It uses the `{categories}` placeholder for the categories.
- **Enable Auto-Fixing**: When enabled, the node automatically fixes model outputs to ensure they match the expected format. Do this by sending the schema parsing error to the LLM and asking it to fix it.

1. If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don’t want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**. The **Use cases** page opens.
1. Select **Other**, then select **Next**.
1. Select **Business** and **Next**.
1. Complete the essential information:
   - Add an **App name**.
   - Add an **App contact email**.
   - Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it.
1. Select **Create app**. The **Add products to your app** page opens.
1. Select **Facebook Login for Business**. The **Settings** page for this product opens.
1. Copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** from your n8n credential.
1. In your Meta app settings in **Client OAuth settings**, paste that URL as the **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs**.
1. Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
1. Copy the **App ID** and enter it as the **Client ID** within your n8n credential.
1. Copy the **App Secret** and enter it as the **Client Secret** within your n8n credential.

Your credential should successfully connect now, but you'll need to go through the steps to take your Meta app live before you can use it with the [Facebook Lead Ads trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebookleadadstrigger/). Here's a summary of what you'll need to do:

1. In your Meta app, select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
1. Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app "Live.")
1. Select **Save changes**.
1. At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.
1. Facebook Login for Business requires Advanced Access for `public_profile`. To add it, go to **App Review > Permissions and Features**.
1. Search for `public_profile` and select **Request advanced access**.
1. Complete the steps for [business verification](https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-verified-for-business/).
1. Use the [Lead Ads Testing Tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing) to trigger some demo form submissions and test your workflow.

Refer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.

For more information on the app modes and switching to **Live** mode, refer to [App Modes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes) and [Publish | App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release#app-types).

Refer to [Facebook Lead Ads' documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/guides/lead-ads/) for details about their API.

Here are some common errors and issues with the Facebook Lead Ads Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Workflow only works in testing or production

Facebook Lead Ads only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Facebook Lead Ads overwrites the registered webhook URL.

You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Facebook Lead Ads will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.

To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:

Halts production traffic

This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.

1. Go to your workflow page.
1. Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.
1. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.
1. When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

## OpenAI Chat Model node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#openai-chat-model-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Processing parameters
- The service is receiving too many requests from you
- Insufficient quota
- Bad request - please check your parameters

Here are some common errors and issues with the [OpenAI Chat Model node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters

The OpenAI Chat Model node is a [sub-node](../../../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n). Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including [root nodes](../../../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n), take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## The service is receiving too many requests from you

This error displays when you've exceeded [OpenAI's rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits).

There are two ways to work around this issue:

1. Split your data up into smaller chunks using the [Loop Over Items](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node and add a [Wait](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) node at the end for a time amount that will help. Copy the code below and paste it into a workflow to use as a template.

1. Use the [HTTP Request](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node with the built-in batch-limit option against the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) instead of using the OpenAI node.

## Insufficient quota

There are a number of OpenAI issues surrounding quotas, including failures when quotas have been recently topped up. To avoid these issues, ensure that there is credit in the account and issue a new API key from the [API keys screen](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).

This error displays when your OpenAI account doesn't have enough credits or capacity to fulfill your request. This may mean that your OpenAI trial period has ended, that your account needs more credit, or that you've gone over a usage limit.

To troubleshoot this error, on your [OpenAI settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) page:

- Select the correct organization for your API key in the first selector in the upper-left corner.
- Select the correct project for your API key in the second selector in the upper-left corner.
- Check the organization-level [billing overview](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) page to ensure that the organization has enough credit. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page.
- Check the organization-level [usage limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) page. Double-check that you select the correct organization for this page and scroll to the **Usage limits** section to verify that you haven't exceeded your organization's usage limits.
- Check your OpenAI project's usage limits. Double-check that you select the correct project in the second selector in the upper-left corner. Select **Project** > **Limits** to view or change the project limits.
- Check that the [OpenAI API](https://status.openai.com/) is operating as expected.

Balance waiting period

After topping up your balance, there may be a delay before your OpenAI account reflects the new balance.

- check that the [OpenAI credentials](../../../../credentials/openai/) use a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for the account you've added money to
- ensure that you connect the [OpenAI node](../../../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/) to the correct [OpenAI credentials](../../../../credentials/openai/)

If you find yourself frequently running out of account credits, consider turning on auto recharge in your [OpenAI billing settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) to automatically reload your account with credits when your balance reaches $0.

## Bad request - please check your parameters

This error displays when the request results in an error but n8n wasn't able to interpret the error message from OpenAI.

To begin troubleshooting, try running the same operation using the [HTTP Request](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node, which should provide a more detailed error message.

1. Select **Open Past Execution** .
1. Double click the node whose data you want to copy.
1. If it's table layout, select **JSON** to switch to JSON view.
1. There are two ways to copy the JSON:
1. Select the JSON you want by highlighting it, like selecting text. Then use `ctrl` + `c` to copy it.
1. Select the JSON you want to copy by clicking on a parameter. Then:
   1. Hover over the JSON. n8n displays the **Copy** button.
   1. Select **Copy** .
   1. You can choose what to copy:
      - **Copy Item Path** and **Copy Parameter Path** gives you expressions that access parts of the JSON.
      - **Copy Value**: copies the entire selected JSON.
1. Return to the workflow you're working on:
   1. Open the left menu.
   1. Select **Workflows**.
   1. Select **Open**.
   1. Select the workflow you want to open.
1. Open the node where you want to use the copied data.

## Auto-fixing Output Parser node

**URL:** llms-txt#auto-fixing-output-parser-node

**Contents:**
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

The Auto-fixing Output Parser node wraps another output parser. If the first one fails, it calls out to another LLM to fix any errors.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Custom API operations

**URL:** llms-txt#custom-api-operations

**Contents:**
- Predefined credential types
  - Using predefined credential types
  - Credential scopes

One of the most complex parts of setting up [API](../../glossary/#api) calls is managing authentication. n8n provides [credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n) support for operations and services beyond those supported by built-in nodes.

- Custom operations for existing nodes: n8n supplies hundreds of nodes to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the [HTTP Request](../builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.
- Credential-only nodes: n8n includes credential-only nodes. These are integrations where n8n supports setting up credentials for use in the HTTP Request node, but doesn't provide a standalone node. You can find a credential-only node in the nodes panel, as you would for any other integration.

## Predefined credential types

A predefined credential type is a credential that already exists in n8n. You can use predefined credential types instead of generic credentials in the HTTP Request node.

For example: you create an Asana credential, for use with the Asana node. Later, you want to perform an operation that isn't supported by the Asana node, using Asana's API. You can use your existing Asana credential in the HTTP Request node to perform the operation, without additional authentication setup.

### Using predefined credential types

To use a predefined credential type:

1. Open your HTTP Request node, or add a new one to your workflow.
1. In **Authentication**, select **Predefined Credential Type**.
1. In **Credential Type**, select the API you want to use.
1. In **Credential for `<API name>`**, you can:
   1. Select an existing credential for that platform, if available.
   1. Select **Create New** to create a new credential.

### Credential scopes

Some existing credential types have specific scopes: endpoints that they work with. n8n warns you about this when you select the credential type.

For example, follow the steps in [Using predefined credential types](#using-predefined-credential-types), and select **Google Calendar OAuth2 API** as your **Credential Type**. n8n displays a box listing the two endpoints you can use this credential type with:

## Manual, partial, and production executions

**URL:** llms-txt#manual,-partial,-and-production-executions

**Contents:**
- Manual executions
- Partial executions
  - Troubleshooting partial executions
- Production executions

There are some important differences in how n8n executes workflows manually (by clicking the **Execute Workflow** button) and automatically (when the workflow is **Active** and triggered by an event or schedule).

Manual executions allow you to run workflows directly from the [canvas](../../../glossary/#canvas-n8n) to test your workflow logic. These executions are "ad-hoc": they run only when you manually select the **Execute workflow** button.

Manual executions make building workflows easier by allowing you to iteratively test as you go, following the flow logic and seeing data transformations. You can test conditional branching, data formatting changes, and loop behavior by providing different input items and modifying node options.

Pinning execution data

When performing manual executions, you can use [data pinning](../../../data/data-pinning/) to "pin" or "freeze" the output data of a node. You can optionally [edit the pinned data](../../../data/data-editing/) as well.

On future runs, instead of executing the pinned node, n8n will substitute the pinned data and continue following the flow logic. This allows you to iterate without operating on variable data or repeating queries to external services. Production executions ignore all pinned data.

## Partial executions

Clicking the **Execute workflow** button at the bottom of the workflow in the **Editor** tab manually runs the entire workflow. You can also perform partial executions to run specific steps in your workflow. Partial executions are manual executions that only run a subset of your workflow nodes.

To perform a partial execution, select a node, open its detail view, and select **Execute step**. This executes the specific node and any preceding nodes required to fill in its input data. You can also temporarily disable specific nodes in the workflow chain to avoid interacting with those services while building.

In particular, partial executions are useful when updating the logic of a specific node since they allow you to re-execute the node with the same input data.

### Troubleshooting partial executions

Some common issues you might come across when running partial executions include the following:

> The destination node is not connected to any trigger. Partial executions need a trigger.

This error message appears when you try to perform a partial execution without connecting the workflow to a trigger. Manual executions, including partial executions, attempt to mimic production executions when possible. Part of this includes requiring a trigger node to describe when the workflow logic should execute.

To work around this, connect a trigger node to the workflow with the node you're trying to execute. Most often, a [manual trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger/) is the simplest option.

> Please execute the whole workflow, rather than just the node. (Existing execution data is too large.)

This error can appear when performing partial executions on workflows with large numbers of branches. Partial executions involve sending data and workflow logic to the n8n backend in a way that isn't required for full executions. This error occurs when your workflow exceeds the maximum size allowed for these messages.

To work around this, consider using the [limit node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.limit/) to limit node output while running partial executions. Once the workflow is running as intended, you can disable or delete the limit node before enabling production execution.

## Production executions

Production executions occur when a triggering event or schedule automatically runs a workflow.

To configure production executions, you must attach a [trigger node](../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n) (any trigger other than the [manual trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger/) works) and switch workflow's toggle to **Active**. Once activated, the workflow automatically executes whenever the trigger condition occurs.

The execution flow for production executions doesn't display in the Editor tab of the workflow as with manual executions. Instead, you can see executions in the workflow's **Executions** tab according to your [workflow settings](../../settings/). From there, you can explore and troubleshoot problems using the [debug in editor feature](../debug/).

## Executions

**URL:** llms-txt#executions

**Contents:**
- Execution modes
- Execution lists

An execution is a single run of a workflow.

There are two execution modes:

- Manual: run workflows manually when testing. Select **Execute Workflow** to start a manual execution. You can do manual executions of active workflows, but n8n recommends keeping your workflow set to **Inactive** while developing and testing.
- Production: a production workflow is one that runs automatically. To enable this, set the workflow to **Active**.

n8n provides two execution lists:

- [Workflow-level executions](single-workflow-executions/): this execution list shows the executions for a single workflow.
- [All executions](all-executions/): this list shows all executions for all your workflows.

n8n supports [adding custom data to executions](custom-executions-data/).

Use the Redis Chat Memory node to use Redis as a [memory](../../../../../glossary/#ai-memory) server.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Redis Chat Memory node supports, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/redis/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Session Key**: Enter the key to use to store the memory in the workflow data.
- **Session Time To Live**: Use this parameter to make the session expire after a given number of seconds.
- **Context Window Length**: Enter the number of previous interactions to consider for context.

## Single memory instance

If you add more than one Redis Chat Memory node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the [Chat Memory Manager](../n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.

## Expressions

**URL:** llms-txt#expressions

**Contents:**
- Writing expressions
  - Example: Get data from webhook body
  - Example: Writing longer JavaScript
- Common issues

Expressions are a powerful feature implemented in all n8n nodes. They allow node parameters to be set dynamically based on data from:

- Previous node executions
- The workflow
- Your n8n environment

You can also execute JavaScript within an expression, making this a convenient and easy way to manipulate data into useful parameter values without writing extensive extra code.

n8n created and uses a templating language called [Tournament](https://github.com/n8n-io/tournament), and extends it with [custom methods and variables](../builtin/overview/) and [data transformation functions](../builtin/data-transformation-functions/). These features make it easier to perform common tasks like getting data from other nodes or accessing workflow metadata.

n8n additionally supports two libraries:

- [Luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon/), for working with dates and time.
- [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/), for querying JSON.

When writing expressions, it's helpful to understand data structure and behavior in n8n. Refer to [Data](../../data/) for more information on working with data in your workflows.

## Writing expressions

To use an expression to set a parameter value:

1. Hover over the parameter where you want to use an expression.
1. Select **Expressions** in the **Fixed/Expression** toggle.
1. Write your expression in the parameter, or select **Open expression editor** to open the expressions editor. If you use the expressions editor, you can browse the available data in the **Variable selector**. All expressions have the format `{{ your expression here }}`.

### Example: Get data from webhook body

Consider the following scenario: you have a webhook trigger that receives data through the webhook body. You want to extract some of that data for use in the workflow.

Your webhook data looks similar to this:

In the next node in the workflow, you want to get just the value of `city`. You can use the following expression:

1. Accesses the incoming JSON-formatted data using n8n's custom `$json` variable.
1. Finds the value of `city` (in this example, "New York"). Note that this example uses JMESPath syntax to query the JSON data. You can also write this expression as `{{$json['body']['city']}}`.

### Example: Writing longer JavaScript

You can do things like variable assignments or multiple statements in an expression, but you need to wrap your code using the syntax for an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).

The following code use the Luxon date and time library to find the time between two dates in months. We surround the code in both the handlebar brackets for an expression and the IIFE syntax.

For common errors or issues with expressions and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common Issues](../cookbook/expressions/common-issues/).

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
[
  {
    "headers": {
      "host": "n8n.instance.address",
      ...
    },
    "params": {},
    "query": {},
    "body": {
      "name": "Jim",
      "age": 30,
      "city": "New York"
    }
  }
]
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
{{$json.body.city}}
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
{{(()=>{
  let end = DateTime.fromISO('2017-03-13');
  let start = DateTime.fromISO('2017-02-13');
  let diffInMonths = end.diff(start, 'months');
  return diffInMonths.toObject();
})()}}
```

## Ollama Chat Model node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#ollama-chat-model-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Processing parameters
- Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance
- Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker
  - If only Ollama is in Docker
  - If only n8n is in Docker
  - If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers
  - If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container
- Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434
- Ollama and HTTP/HTTPS proxies

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Ollama Chat Model node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Processing parameters

The Ollama Chat Model node is a [sub-node](../../../../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n). Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.

Most nodes, including [root nodes](../../../../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n), take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance

The Ollama Chat Model node supports Bearer token authentication for connecting to remote Ollama instances behind authenticated proxies (such as Open WebUI).

For remote authenticated connections, configure both the remote URL and API key in your Ollama credentials.

Follow the [Ollama credentials instructions](../../../../credentials/ollama/) for more information.

## Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker

The Ollama Chat Model node connects to a locally hosted Ollama instance using the base URL defined by [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/). When you run either n8n or Ollama in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Ollama.

Ollama typically listens for connections on `localhost`, the local network address. In Docker, by default, each container has its own `localhost` which is only accessible from within the container. If either n8n or Ollama are running in containers, they won't be able to connect over `localhost`.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only Ollama is in Docker

If only Ollama is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the ports](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, Ollama runs on port 11434, so your Docker command should look like this:

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **base URL** to `http://localhost:11434`).

### If only n8n is in Docker

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), use `host.docker.internal` as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, to bind to the default port 11434, you could set the base URL to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers

If both n8n and Ollama are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When configuring [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/), use the Ollama container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the Ollama container `my-ollama` and it listens on the default port 11434, you would set the base URL to `http://my-ollama:11434`.

### If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container

If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure Ollama to listen on localhost and configure the base URL in the [Ollama credentials in n8n](../../../../credentials/ollama/) to use localhost: `http://localhost:11434`.

## Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434

This error occurs when your computer has IPv6 enabled, but Ollama is listening to an IPv4 address.

To fix this, change the base URL in your [Ollama credentials](../../../../credentials/ollama/) to connect to `127.0.0.1`, the IPv4-specific local address, instead of the `localhost` alias that can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`.

## Ollama and HTTP/HTTPS proxies

Ollama doesn't support custom HTTP agents in its configuration. This makes it difficult to use Ollama behind custom HTTP/HTTPS proxies. Depending on your proxy configuration, it might not work at all, despite setting the `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.

Refer to [Ollama's FAQ](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-do-i-use-ollama-behind-a-proxy) for more information.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
```

Use the Milvus node to interact with your Milvus database as [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store). You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain), or connect directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Milvus node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/milvus/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the Milvus Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert and retrieve documents

You can use the Milvus Vector Store as a regular node to insert, or get documents. This pattern places the Milvus Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

See this [example template](https://n8n.io/workflows/3573-create-a-rag-system-with-paul-essays-milvus-and-openai-for-cited-answers/) for how to build a system that stores documents in Milvus and retrieves them to support cited, chat-based answers.

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the Milvus Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Milvus Vector Store node. See this [example template](https://n8n.io/workflows/3576-paul-graham-essay-search-and-chat-with-milvus-vector-database/) where data is embedded and indexed in Milvus, and the AI Agent uses the vector store as a knowledge tool for question-answering.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Milvus Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Milvus Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

A typical node connection flow looks like this: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Milvus Vector Store.

Check out this [workflow example](https://n8n.io/workflows/3574-create-a-paul-graham-essay-qanda-system-with-openai-and-milvus-vector-database/) to see how to ingest external data into Milvus and build a chat-based semantic Q&A system.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Milvus Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Milvus Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The connections flow would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Milvus Vector store.

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt is embedded and used for similarity search. The node returns the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents

Use insert documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Tool for AI Agent)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters

- **Milvus Collection**: Select or enter the Milvus Collection to use.
- **Prompt**: Enter your search query.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Insert Documents parameters

- **Milvus Collection**: Select or enter the Milvus Collection to use.
- **Clear Collection**: Specify whether to clear the collection before inserting new documents.

### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters

- **Milvus collection**: Select or enter the Milvus Collection to use.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters

- **Name**: The name of the vector store.
- **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
- **Milvus Collection**: Select or enter the Milvus Collection to use.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

Available in **Get Many** mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document.

This is an `AND` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.

When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.

Available in **Insert Documents** mode. Deletes all data from the collection before inserting the new data.

## Retrieve linked items from earlier in the workflow

**URL:** llms-txt#retrieve-linked-items-from-earlier-in-the-workflow

Every item in a node's input data links back to the items used in previous nodes to generate it. This is useful if you need to retrieve linked items from further back than the immediate previous node.

To access the linked items from earlier in the workflow, use `("<node-name>").itemMatching(currentNodeinputIndex)`.

For example, consider a workflow that does the following:

1. The Customer Datastore node generates example data:

1. The Edit Fields node simplifies this data:

1. The Code node restore the email address to the correct person:

The Code node does this using the following code:

You can view and download the example workflow from [n8n website | itemMatchin usage example](https://n8n.io/workflows/1966-itemmatching-usage-example/) .

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown

Use the Custom Code Tool node to write code that an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) can run.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Custom Code Tool node and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

Give your custom code a description. This tells the agent when to use this tool. For example:

> Call this tool to get a random color. The input should be a string with comma separated names of colors to exclude.

You can use JavaScript or Python.

### JavaScript / Python box

You can access the tool input using `query`. For example, to take the input string and lowercase it:

## AI Agent Tool node

**URL:** llms-txt#ai-agent-tool-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
- Node options
- Templates and examples
- Dynamic parameters for tools with `$fromAI()`

The AI Agent Tool node allows a root-level [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) in your workflow to call other agents as tools to simplify multi-agent orchestration.

The [primary agent](../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/) can supervise and delegate work to AI Agent Tool nodes that specialize in different tasks and knowledge. This allows you to use multiple agents in a single workflow without the complexity of managing context and variables that sub-workflows require. You can nest AI Agent Tool nodes into multiple layers for more complex multi-tiered use cases.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the AI Agent Tool node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

Configure the AI Agent Tool node using these parameters:

- **Description**: Give a description to the LLM of this agent's purpose and scope of responsibility. A good, specific description tells the parent agent when to delegate tasks to this agent for processing.
- **Prompt (User Message)**: The prompt to the LLM explaining what actions to perform and what information to return.
- **Require Specific Output Format**: Whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of the output parsers [described on the main agent page](../../root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/#require-specific-output-format).
- **Enable Fallback Model**: Whether to enable a fallback model. When enabled, n8n prompts you to connect a backup chat model to use in case the primary model fails or isn't available.

Refine the AI Agent Tool node's behavior using these options:

- **System Message**: A message to send to the agent before the conversation starts.
- **Max Iterations**: The maximum number of times the model should run to generate a response before stopping.
- **Return Intermediate Steps**: Whether to include intermediate steps the agent took in the final output.
- **Automatically Passthrough Binary Images**: Whether binary images should be automatically passed through to the agent as image type messages.
- **Batch Processing**: Whether to enable the following batch processing options for rate limiting:
  - **Batch Size**: The number of items to process in parallel. This helps with rate limiting but may impact the log output ordering.
  - **Delay Between Batches**: The number of milliseconds to wait between batches.

n8n provides a trigger node for Airtable. You can find the trigger node docs [here](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtabletrigger/).

Refer to [Airtable's documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction) for more information about the service.

## What to do if your operation isn't supported

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
1. Select the service you want to connect to.
1. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

### Get the Record ID

To fetch data for a particular record, you need the Record ID. There are two ways to get the Record ID.

### Create a Record ID column in Airtable

To create a `Record ID` column in your table, refer to this [article](https://support.airtable.com/docs/finding-airtable-ids). You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.

### Use the List operation

To get the Record ID of your record, you can use the **List** operation of the Airtable node. This operation will return the Record ID along with the fields. You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.

### Filter records when using the List operation

To filter records from your Airtable base, use the **Filter By Formula** option. For example, if you want to return all the users that belong to the organization `n8n`, follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Select 'List' from the **Operation** dropdown list.
1. Enter the base ID and the table name in the **Base ID** and **Table** field, respectively.
1. Click on **Add Option** and select 'Filter By Formula' from the dropdown list.
1. Enter the following formula in the **Filter By Formula** field: `{Organization}='n8n'`.

Similarly, if you want to return all the users that don't belong to the organization `n8n`, use the following formula: `NOT({Organization}='n8n')`.

Refer to the Airtable [documentation](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/203255215-Formula-Field-Reference) to learn more about the formulas.

For common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common Issues](common-issues/).

## Workflow 2: Generating reports

**URL:** llms-txt#workflow-2:-generating-reports

**Contents:**
- Part 1: Getting data from different sources
- Part 2: Generating file for regional sales
- Part 3: Generating files for total sales

In this workflow, you will merge data from different sources, transform binary data, generate files, and send notifications about them. The final workflow should look like this:

*Workflow 2 for aggregating data and generating files*

To make things easier, let's split the workflow into three parts.

## Part 1: Getting data from different sources

The first part of the workflow consists of five nodes:

*Workflow 1: Getting data from different sources*

1. Use the [**HTTP Request node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to get data from the API endpoint that stores company data. Configure the following node parameters:

- **Method**: Get
   - **URL**: The **Dataset URL** you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
   - **Authentication**: Generic Credential Type
     - **Generic Auth Type**: Header Auth
     - **Credentials for Header Auth**: The Header Auth name and Header Auth value you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
   - **Send Headers**: Toggle to true
     - **Specify Headers**: Select `Using Fields Below`
     - **Name**: `unique_id`
     - **Value**: The unique ID you received in the email when you signed up for this course.

1. Use the [**Airtable node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/) to list data from the `customers` table (where you updated the fields `region` and `subregion`).

1. Use the [**Merge node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) to merge data from the Airtable and HTTP Request node, based on matching the input fields for `customerID`.

1. Use the [**Sort node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/) to sort data by `orderPrice` in descending order.

- What's the name of the employee assigned to customer 1?
- What's the order status of customer 2?
- What's the highest order price?

## Part 2: Generating file for regional sales

The second part of the workflow consists of four nodes:

*Workflow 2: Generating file for regional sales*

1. Use the [**If node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) to filter to only display orders from the region `Americas`.
1. Use the [**Convert to File**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to transform the incoming data from JSON to binary format. Convert each item to a separate file. (Bonus points if you can figure out how to name each report based on the orderID!)
1. Use the [**Gmail node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) (or another email node) to send the files using email to an address you have access to. Note that you need to add an attachment with the data property.
1. Use the [**Discord node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/) to send a message in the n8n Discord channel `#course-level-two`. In the node, configure the following parameters:
   - **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
   - **Text**: "I sent the file using email with the label ID `{label ID}`. My ID: " followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.\
     Note that you need to replace the text in curly braces `{}` with [expressions](../../../../glossary/#expression-n8n) that reference the data from the nodes.

- How many orders are assigned to the `Americas` region?
- What's the total price of the orders in the `Americas` region?
- How many items does the **Write Binary File node** return?

## Part 3: Generating files for total sales

The third part of the workflow consists of five nodes:

*Workflow 3: Generating files for total sales*

1. Use the [**Loop Over Items node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) to split data from the Item Lists node into batches of 5.
1. Use the [**Set node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) to set four values, referenced with expressions from the previous node: `customerEmail`, `customerRegion`, `customerSince`, and `orderPrice`.
1. Use the [**Date & Time node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/) to change the date format of the field `customerSince` to the format MM/DD/YYYY.
   - Set the **Include Input Fields** option to keep all the data together.
1. Use the [**Convert to File node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to create a CSV spreadsheet with the file name set as the expression: `{{$runIndex > 0 ? 'file_low_orders':'file_high_orders'}}`.
1. Use the [**Discord node**](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/) to send a message in the n8n Discord channel `#course-level-two`. In the node, configure the following parameters:
   - **Webhook URL**: The Discord URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.
   - **Text**: "I created the spreadsheet `{file name}`. My ID:" followed by the unique ID emailed to you when you registered for this course.\
     Note that you need to replace `{file name}` with an expression that references data from the previous **Convert to File node**.

- What's the lowest order price in the first batch of items?
- What's the formatted date of customer 7?
- How many items does the **Convert to File node** return?

To check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:

## Executions environment variables

**URL:** llms-txt#executions-environment-variables

File-based configuration

You can add `_FILE` to individual variables to provide their configuration in a separate file. Refer to [Keeping sensitive data in separate files](../../configuration-methods/#keeping-sensitive-data-in-separate-files) for more details.

This page lists environment variables to configure workflow execution settings.

## WhatsApp Business Cloud credentials

**URL:** llms-txt#whatsapp-business-cloud-credentials

**Contents:**
- Requirements
- Supported authentication methods
- Related resources
- Using API key
- Using OAuth2

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [WhatsApp Business Cloud](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.whatsapp/)
- [WhatsApp Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.whatsapptrigger/)

To create credentials for WhatsApp, you need the following Meta assets:

- A [Meta developer](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/register) account: A developer account allows you to create and manage Meta apps, including WhatsApp integrations.

Set up a Meta developer account

1. Visit the [Facebook Developers site](https://developers.facebook.com).
1. Click **Getting Started** in the upper-right corner (if the link says **My Apps**, you've already set up a developer account).
1. Agree to terms and conditions.
1. Provide a phone number for verification.
1. Select your occupation or role.

- A Meta [business portfolio](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1710077379203657?id=180505742745347): WhatsApp messaging services require a Meta business portfolio, formerly called a Business Manager account. The UI may still show either option.

Set up a Meta business portfolio

1. Visit the [Facebook Business site](https://business.facebook.com).
1. Select **Create an account**.
   - If you already have a Facebook Business account and portfolio, but want a new portfolio, open the business portfolio selector in the left-side menu and select **Create a business portfolio**.
1. Enter a **Business portfolio name**.
1. Enter your **name**.
1. Enter a **business email**.
1. Select **Submit** or **Create**.

- A Meta [business app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/) configured with WhatsApp: Once you have a developer account, you will create a Meta business app.

Set up a Meta business app with WhatsApp

1. Visit the [Meta for Developers Apps dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)
1. Select **Create app**.
1. In **Add products to your app**, select **Set up** in the WhatsApp tile. Refer to [Add the WhatsApp Product](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/solution-providers/get-started-for-tech-providers#step-3--add-the-whatsapp-product) for more detail.
1. This opens the WhatsApp **Quickstart** page. Select your business portfolio.
1. Select **Continue**.
1. In the left-side menu, go to **App settings** > **Basic**.
1. Set the **Privacy Policy URL** and **Terms of Service URL** for the app.
1. Change the **App Mode** to **Live**.

## Supported authentication methods

- API key: Use for the [WhatsApp Business Cloud](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.whatsapp/) node.
- OAuth2: Use for the [WhatsApp Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.whatsapptrigger/) node.

Refer to [WhatsApp's API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/#platform-apis) for more information about the service.

Meta classifies users who create WhatsApp business apps as Tech Providers; refer to Meta's [Get Started for Tech Providers](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/solution-providers/get-started-for-tech-providers) for more information.

You need WhatsApp API key credentials to use the [WhatsApp Business Cloud](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.whatsapp/) node.

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- An API **Access Token**
- A **Business Account ID**

To generate an access token, follow these steps:

## Notion node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#notion-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Relation property not displaying
- Create toggle heading
- Handle null and empty values

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Notion node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Relation property not displaying

The Notion node only supports displaying the data relation property for [two-way relations](https://www.notion.com/help/relations-and-rollups). When you connect two Notion databases with a two-way relationship, you can select or filter by the relation property when working with the Notion node's **Database Page** resource.

To enable two-way relations, edit the relation property in Notion and enable the **Show on [name of related database]** option to create a reverse relation. Select a name to use for the relation in the new context. The relation is now accessible in n8n when filtering or selecting.

If you need to work with Notion databases with one-way relationship, you can use the [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) with your existing Notion credentials. For example, to update a one-way relationship, you can send a `PATCH` request to the following URL:

Enable **Send Body**, set the **Body Content Type** to **JSON**, and set **Specify Body** to **Using JSON**. Afterward, you can enter a JSON object like the following into the **JSON** field:

## Create toggle heading

The Notion node allows you to create headings and toggles when adding blocks to **Page**, **Database Page**, or **Block** resources. Creating toggleable headings isn't yet supported by the Notion node itself.

You can work around this be creating a regular heading and then modifying it to enable the [`is_toggleable` property](https://developers.notion.com/reference/block#headings):

1. Add a heading with Notion node.
1. Select the resource you want to add a heading to:
   - To add a new page with a heading, select the **Page** or **Database Page** resources with the **Create** operation.
   - To add a heading to an existing page, select the **Block** resource with the **Append After** operation.
1. Select **Add Block** and set the **Type Name or ID** to either **Heading 1**, **Heading 2**, or **Heading 3**.
1. Add an [HTTP Request](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node connected to the Notion node and select the `GET` method.
1. Set the **URL** to `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/<block_ID>`. For example, if your added the heading to an existing page, you could use the following URL: `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.results[0].id }}`. If you created a new page instead of appending a block, you may need to discover the block ID by querying the page contents first.
1. Select **Predefined Credential Type** and connect your existing Notion credentials.
1. Add an [Edit Fields (Set)](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node after the HTTP Request node.
1. Add `heading_1.is_toggleable` as a new **Boolean** field set to `true`. Swap `heading_1` for a different heading number as necessary.
1. Add a second HTTP Request node after the Edit Fields (Set) node.
1. Set the **Method** to `PATCH` and use `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.id }}` as the **URL** value.
1. Select **Predefined Credential Type** and connect your existing Notion credentials.
1. Enable **Send Body** and set a parameter.
1. Set the parameter **Name** to `heading_1` (substitute `heading_1` for the heading level you are using).
1. Set the parameter **Value** to `{{ $json.heading_1 }}` (substitute `heading_1` for the heading level you are using).

The above sequence will create a regular heading block. It will query the newly created header, add the `is_toggleable` property, and update the heading block.

## Handle null and empty values

You may receive a validation error when working with the Notion node if you submit fields with empty or null values. This can occur any time you populate fields from previous nodes when that data is missing.

To work around this, check for the existence of the field data before sending it to Notion or use a default value.

To check for the data before executing the Notion node, use an [If](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) node to check whether the field is unset. This allows you to use the [Edit Fields (Set)](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node to conditionally remove the field when it doesn't have a valid value.

As an alternative, you can set a [default value](../../../../../code/cookbook/expressions/check-incoming-data/) if the incoming data doesn't provide one.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
https://api.notion.com/v1/pages/<page_id>
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
{
	"properties": {
		"Account": {
			"relation": [
				{
					"id": "<your_relation_ID>"
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

Use the Data Table node to permanently save data across workflow executions in a table format. It provides functionality to perform various data operations on stored data. See [Data tables](../../../../data/data-tables/).

Select the resource on which you want to operate.

Select the operation you want to run on the resource:

- **Delete:** Delete one or more rows.
- **Dry Run:** Simulate a deletion before finalizing it. If you switch on this option, n8n returns the rows that will be deleted by the operation. Default state is `off`.
- **Get:** Get one or more rows from your table based on defined filters.
- **Limit**: The number of rows you want to return, specified as a number. Default value is 50.
- **Return all:** Switch on to return all data. Default value is `off`.
- **If Row Exists:** Specify a set of conditions to match input items that exist in the data table.
- **If Row Does Not Exist:** Specify a set of conditions to match input items that don't exist in the data table.
- **Insert:** Insert rows into an existing table.
- **Optimize Bulk**: Optimize the speed of insertions when working with many rows. If you switch on this option, n8n won't return the data that was inserted. Default state is `off`.
- **Update:** Update one or more rows.
- **Upsert:** Upsert one or more rows. If the row exists, it's updated; otherwise, a new row is created.

## MySQL node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#mysql-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Update rows by composite key
- Can't connect to a local MySQL server when using Docker
  - If only MySQL is in Docker
  - If only n8n is in Docker
  - If MySQL and n8n are running in separate Docker containers
  - If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container
- Decimal numbers returned as strings

Here are some common errors and issues with the [MySQL node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Update rows by composite key

The MySQL node's **Update** operation lets you to update rows in a table by providing a **Column to Match On** and a value. This works for tables where single column values can uniquely identify individual rows.

You can't use this pattern for tables that use [composite keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_key), where you need multiple columns to uniquely identify a row. A example of this is MySQL's [`user` table](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysql-user-table/) in the `mysql` database, where you need both the `user` and `host` columns to uniquely identify rows.

To update tables with composite keys, write the query manually with the **Execute SQL** operation instead. There, you can match on multiple values, like in this example which matches on both `customer_id` and `product_id`:

## Can't connect to a local MySQL server when using Docker

When you run either n8n or MySQL in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to MySQL.

The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.

### If only MySQL is in Docker

If only MySQL is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).

When running the container, [publish the port](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, MySQL runs on port 3306, so your Docker command should look like this:

When configuring [MySQL credentials](../../../credentials/mysql/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **Host** to `localhost`).

### If only n8n is in Docker

If only n8n is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.

If you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:

If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.

When configuring [MySQL credentials](../../../credentials/mysql/), use `host.docker.internal` as the **Host** address instead of `localhost`.

### If MySQL and n8n are running in separate Docker containers

If both n8n and MySQL are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.

Configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way). Add both the MySQL and n8n containers to the same [user-defined bridge network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/).

When configuring [MySQL credentials](../../../credentials/mysql/), use the MySQL container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the MySQL container `my-mysql`, you would set the **Host** to `my-mysql`.

### If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container

If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure MySQL to listen on `localhost` and configure the **Host** in the [MySQL credentials in n8n](../../../credentials/ollama/) to use `localhost`.

## Decimal numbers returned as strings

By default, the MySQL node returns [`DECIMAL` values](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/fixed-point-types.html) as strings. This is done intentionally to avoid loss of precision that can occur due to limitation with the way JavaScript represents numbers. You can learn more about the decision in the documentation for the [MySQL library](https://sidorares.github.io/node-mysql2/docs/api-and-configurations) that n8n uses.

To output decimal values as numbers instead of strings and ignore the risks in loss of precision, enable the **Output Decimals as Numbers** option. This will output the values as numbers instead of strings.

As an alternative, you can manually convert from the string to a decimal using the [`toFloat()` function](../../../../../code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/strings/#string-toFloat) with [`toFixed()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed) or with the [Edit Fields (Set) node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) after the MySQL node. Be aware that you may still need to account for a potential loss of precision.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
UPDATE orders SET quantity = 3 WHERE customer_id = 538 AND product_id = 800;
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
docker run -p 3306:3306 --name my-mysql -d mysql:latest
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n

- How data passes between workflows
- Sub-workflow conversion

You can call one workflow from another workflow. This allows you to build modular, microservice-like workflows. It can also help if your workflow grows large enough to encounter [memory issues](../../hosting/scaling/memory-errors/). Creating sub-workflows uses the [Execute Workflow](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) and [Execute Sub-workflow Trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/) nodes.

Sub-wokflow executions don't count towards your plan's monthly execution or active workflow limits.

## Set up and use a sub-workflow

This section walks through setting up both the parent workflow and sub-workflow.

### Create the sub-workflow

1. Create a new workflow.

Create sub-workflows from existing workflows

You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the [Execute Sub-workflow](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node. In the node, select the **Database** and **From list** options and select **Create a sub-workflow** in the list.

You can also extract selected nodes directly using [Sub-workflow conversion](../../workflows/subworkflow-conversion/) in the context menu.

1. **Optional**: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:

1. Select the **Options** menu > **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
   1. Change the **This workflow can be called by** setting. Refer to [Workflow settings](../../workflows/settings/) for more information on configuring your workflows.

1. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled **When Executed by Another Workflow**).

1. Set the **Input data mode** to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:

- **Define using fields below**: Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide. The [Execute Sub-workflow node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) or [Call n8n Workflow Tool node](../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) in the calling workflow will automatically pull in the fields defined here.
   - **Define using JSON example**: Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.
   - **Accept all data**: Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.

1. Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.

1. Save the sub-workflow.

Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors

If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.

Load data into sub-workflow before building

This requires the ability to [load data from previous executions](../../workflows/executions/debug/), which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.

If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:

1. Create the sub-workflow and add the **Execute Sub-workflow Trigger**.
1. Set the node's **Input data mode** to **Accept all data** or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.
1. In the sub-workflow [settings](../../workflows/settings/), set **Save successful production executions** to **Save**.
1. Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
1. Follow the steps to [load data from previous executions](../../workflows/executions/debug/).
1. Adjust the **Input data mode** to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.

You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.

### Call the sub-workflow

1. Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.

1. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** node.

1. In the **Execute Sub-workflow** node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.

Find your workflow ID

Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.

1. Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.

1. Save your workflow.

When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.

You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the **View sub-execution** link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.

## How data passes between workflows

As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called **Workflow B**:

1. The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of **Workflow B**.
1. The last node of **Workflow B** sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**.

## Sub-workflow conversion

See [sub-workflow conversion](../../workflows/subworkflow-conversion/) for how to divide your existing workflows into sub-workflows.

## Model Selector

**URL:** llms-txt#model-selector

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Number of Inputs
  - Rules
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

The Model Selector node dynamically selects one of the connected language models during workflow execution based on a set of defined conditions. This enables implementing fallback mechanisms for error handling or choosing the optimal model for specific tasks.

This page covers node parameters for the Model Selector node and includes links to related resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

Specifies the number of input connections available for attaching language models.

Each rule defines the model to use when specific conditions match.

The Model Selector node evaluates rules sequentially, starting from the first input, and stops evaluation as soon as it finds a match. This means that if multiple rules would match, n8n will only use the model defined by the first matching rule.

The HTTP Request node supports pagination. This page provides some example configurations, including using the [HTTP node variables](../../../builtin/http-node-variables/).

Refer to [HTTP Request](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) for more information on the node.

Different APIs implement pagination in different ways. Check the API documentation for the API you're using for details. You need to find out things like:

- Does the API provide the URL for the next page?
- Are there API-specific limits on page size or page number?
- The structure of the data that the API returns.

In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option** > **Pagination**.

## Use a URL from the response to get the next page using `$response`

If the API returns the URL of the next page in its response:

1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Response Contains Next URL**. n8n displays the parameters for this option.

1. In **Next URL**, use an [expression](../../../../glossary/#expression-n8n) to set the URL. The exact expression depends on the data returned by your API. For example, if the API includes a parameter called `next-page` in the response body:

## Get the next page by number using `$pageCount`

If the API you're using supports targeting a specific page by number:

1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Update a Parameter in Each Request**.
1. Set **Type** to **Query**.
1. Enter the **Name** of the query parameter. This depends on your API and is usually described in its documentation. For example, some APIs use a query parameter named `page` to set the page. So **Name** would be `page`.
1. Hover over **Value** and toggle **Expression** on.
1. Enter `{{ $pageCount + 1 }}`

`$pageCount` is the number of pages the HTTP Request node has fetched. It starts at zero. Most API pagination counts from one (the first page is page one). This means that adding `+1` to `$pageCount` means the node fetches page one on its first loop, page two on its second, and so on.

## Navigate pagination through body parameters

If the API you're using allows you to paginate through the body parameters:

1. Set the HTTP Request Method to **POST**
1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Update a Parameter in Each Request**.
1. Select **Body** in the **Type** parameter.
1. Enter the **Name** of the body parameter. This depends on the API you're using. `page` is a common key name.
1. Hover over **Value** and toggle **Expression** on.
1. Enter `{{ $pageCount + 1 }}`

## Set the page size in the query

If the API you're using supports choosing the page size in the query:

1. Select **Send Query Parameters** in main node parameters (this is the parameters you see when you first open the node, not the settings within options).
1. Enter the **Name** of the query parameter. This depends on your API. For example, a lot of APIs use a query parameter named `limit` to set page size. So **Name** would be `limit`.
1. In **Value**, enter your page size.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
{{ $response.body["next-page"] }}
```

  - Call the sub-workflow
- How data passes between workflows

Use the Execute Sub-workflow node to run a different workflow on the host machine that runs n8n.

Select where the node should get the sub-workflow's information from:

- **Database**: Select this option to load the workflow from the database by ID. You must also enter either:
  - **From list**: Select the workflow from a list of workflows available to your account.
  - **Workflow ID**: Enter the ID for the workflow. The URL of the workflow contains the ID after `/workflow/`. For example, if the URL of a workflow is `https://my-n8n-acct.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/abCDE1f6gHiJKL7`, the **Workflow ID** is `abCDE1f6gHiJKL7`.
- **Local File**: Select this option to load the workflow from a locally saved JSON file. You must also enter:
  - **Workflow Path**: Enter the path to the local JSON workflow file you want the node to execute.
- **Parameter**: Select this option to load the workflow from a parameter. You must also enter:
  - **Workflow JSON**: Enter the JSON code you want the node to execute.
- **URL**: Select this option to load the workflow from a URL. You must also enter:
  - **Workflow URL**: Enter the URL you want to load the workflow from.

If you select a sub-workflow using the **database** and **From list** options, the sub-workflow's input items will automatically display, ready for you to fill in or map values.

You can optionally remove requested input items, in which case the sub-workflow receives `null` as the item's value. You can also enable **Attempt to convert types** to try to automatically convert data to the sub-workflow item's requested type.

Input items won't appear if the sub-workflow's Workflow Input Trigger node uses the "Accept all data" input data mode.

Use this parameter to control the execution mode for the node. Choose from these options:

- **Run once with all items**: Pass all input items into a single execution of the node.
- **Run once for each item**: Execute the node once for each input item in turn.

This node includes one option: **Wait for Sub-Workflow Completion**. This lets you control whether the main workflow should wait for the sub-workflow's completion before moving on to the next step (turned on) or whether the main workflow should continue without waiting (turned off).

## Set up and use a sub-workflow

This section walks through setting up both the parent workflow and sub-workflow.

### Create the sub-workflow

1. Create a new workflow.

Create sub-workflows from existing workflows

You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the [Execute Sub-workflow](./) node. In the node, select the **Database** and **From list** options and select **Create a sub-workflow** in the list.

You can also extract selected nodes directly using [Sub-workflow conversion](../../../../workflows/subworkflow-conversion/) in the context menu.

1. **Optional**: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:

1. Select the **Options** menu > **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
   1. Change the **This workflow can be called by** setting. Refer to [Workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/) for more information on configuring your workflows.

1. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled **When Executed by Another Workflow**).

1. Set the **Input data mode** to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:

- **Define using fields below**: Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide. The [Execute Sub-workflow node](./) or [Call n8n Workflow Tool node](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) in the calling workflow will automatically pull in the fields defined here.
   - **Define using JSON example**: Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.
   - **Accept all data**: Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.

1. Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.

1. Save the sub-workflow.

Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors

If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.

Load data into sub-workflow before building

This requires the ability to [load data from previous executions](../../../../workflows/executions/debug/), which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.

If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:

1. Create the sub-workflow and add the **Execute Sub-workflow Trigger**.
1. Set the node's **Input data mode** to **Accept all data** or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.
1. In the sub-workflow [settings](../../../../workflows/settings/), set **Save successful production executions** to **Save**.
1. Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
1. Follow the steps to [load data from previous executions](../../../../workflows/executions/debug/).
1. Adjust the **Input data mode** to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.

You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.

### Call the sub-workflow

1. Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.

1. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** node.

1. In the **Execute Sub-workflow** node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.

Find your workflow ID

Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.

1. Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.

1. Save your workflow.

When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.

You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the **View sub-execution** link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.

## How data passes between workflows

As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called **Workflow B**:

1. The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of **Workflow B**.
1. The last node of **Workflow B** sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**.

## MQTT credentials

**URL:** llms-txt#mqtt-credentials

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Supported authentication methods
- Related resources
- Using broker connection

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes:

- [MQTT](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mqtt/)
- [MQTT Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mqtttrigger/)

Install an [MQTT broker](https://mqtt.org/).

MQTT provides a list of Servers/Brokers at [MQTT Software](https://mqtt.org/software/).

## Supported authentication methods

Refer to [MQTT's documentation](https://mqtt.org/) for more information about the MQTT protocol.

Refer to your broker provider's documentation for more detailed configuration and details.

## Using broker connection

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- Your MQTT broker's **Protocol**
- The **Host**
- The **Port**
- A **Username** and **Password** to authenticate with
- If you're using **SSL**, the relevant certificates and keys

1. Select the broker's **Protocol**, which determines the URL n8n uses. Options include:
   - **Mqtt**: Begin the URL with the standard `mqtt:` protocol.
   - **Mqtts**: Begin the URL with the secure `mqtts:` protocol.
   - **Ws**: Begin the URL with the WebSocket `ws:` protocol.
1. Enter your broker **Host**.
1. Enter the **Port** number n8n should use to connect to the broker host.
1. Enter the **Username** to log into the broker as.
1. Enter that user's **Password**.
1. If you want to receive QoS 1 and 2 messages while offline, turn off the **Clean Session** toggle.
1. Enter a **Client ID** you'd like the credential to use. If you leave this blank, n8n will generate one for you. You can use a fixed or expression-based Client ID.
   - Client IDs can be useful to identify and track connection access. n8n recommends using something with `n8n` in it for easier auditing.
1. If your MQTT broker uses SSL, turn the **SSL** toggle on. Once you turn it on:
   1. Select whether to use **Passwordless** connection with certificates, which is like the SASL mechanism EXTERNAL. If turned on:
      1. Select whether to **Reject Unauthorized Certificate**: If turned off, n8n will connect even if the certificate validation fails.
      1. Add an SSL **Client Certificate**.
      1. Add an SSL **Client Key** for the Client Certificate.
   1. One or more SSL **CA Certificates**.

Refer to your MQTT broker provider's documentation for more detailed configuration instructions.

## Error handling

**URL:** llms-txt#error-handling

**Contents:**
- Create and set an error workflow
- Error data
- Cause a workflow execution failure using Stop And Error

When designing your flow logic, it's a good practice to consider potential errors, and set up methods to handle them gracefully. With an error workflow, you can control how n8n responds to a workflow execution failure.

To investigate failed executions, you can:

- Review your [Executions](../../workflows/executions/), for a [single workflow](../../workflows/executions/single-workflow-executions/) or [all workflows you have access to](../../workflows/executions/all-executions/). You can [load data from previous execution](../../workflows/executions/debug/) into your current workflow.
- Enable [Log streaming](../../log-streaming/).

## Create and set an error workflow

For each workflow, you can set an error workflow in **Workflow Settings**. It runs if an execution fails. This means you can, for example, send email or Slack alerts when a workflow execution errors. The error workflow must start with the [Error Trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.errortrigger/).

You can use the same error workflow for multiple workflows.

1. Create a new workflow, with the Error Trigger as the first node.
1. Give the workflow a name, for example `Error Handler`.
1. Select **Save**.
1. In the workflow where you want to use this error workflow:
   1. Select **Options** > **Settings**.
   1. In **Error workflow**, select the workflow you just created. For example, if you used the name Error Handler, select **Error handler**.
   1. Select **Save**. Now, when this workflow errors, the related error workflow runs.

The default error data received by the Error Trigger is:

All information is always present, except:

- `execution.id`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
- `execution.url`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
- `execution.retryOf`: only present when the execution is a retry of a failed execution.

If the error is caused by the trigger node of the main workflow, rather than a later stage, the data sent to the error workflow is different. There's less information in `execution{}` and more in `trigger{}`:

## Cause a workflow execution failure using Stop And Error

When you create and set an error workflow, n8n runs it when an execution fails. Usually, this is due to things like errors in node settings, or the workflow running out of memory.

You can add the [Stop And Error](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) node to your workflow to force executions to fail under your chosen circumstances, and trigger the error workflow.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
[
	{
		"execution": {
			"id": "231",
			"url": "https://n8n.example.com/execution/231",
			"retryOf": "34",
			"error": {
				"message": "Example Error Message",
				"stack": "Stacktrace"
			},
			"lastNodeExecuted": "Node With Error",
			"mode": "manual"
		},
		"workflow": {
			"id": "1",
			"name": "Example Workflow"
		}
	}
]
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
{
  "trigger": {
    "error": {
      "context": {},
      "name": "WorkflowActivationError",

## Calculator node

**URL:** llms-txt#calculator-node

**Contents:**
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

The Calculator node is a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) that allows an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to run mathematical calculations.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## WhatsApp Business Cloud node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#whatsapp-business-cloud-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Bad request - please check your parameters
- Working with non-text media

Here are some common errors and issues with the [WhatsApp Business Cloud node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Bad request - please check your parameters

This error occurs when WhatsApp Business Cloud rejects your request because of a problem with its parameters. It's common to see this when using the **Send Template** operation if the data you send doesn't match the format of your template.

To resolve this issue, review the parameters in your [message template](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2055875911147364?id=2129163877102343). Pay attention to each parameter's data type and the order they're defined in the template.

Check the data that n8n is mapping to the template parameters. If you're using expressions to set parameter values, check the input data to make sure each item resolves to a valid value. You may want to use the [Edit Fields (Set) node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) or [set a fallback value](../../../../../code/cookbook/expressions/check-incoming-data/) to ensure you send a value with the correct format.

## Working with non-text media

The WhatsApp Business Cloud node can work with non-text messages and media like images, audio, documents, and more.

If your operation includes a **Input Data Field Name** or **Property Name** parameter, set this to the field name itself rather than referencing the data in an expression.

For example, if you are trying to send a message with an "Image" **MessageType** and **Take Image From** set to "n8n", set **Input Data Field Name** to a field name like `data` instead of an expression like `{{ $json.input.data }}`.

## 5. Calculating Booked Orders

**URL:** llms-txt#5.-calculating-booked-orders

**Contents:**
- About the Code node
- Configure the Code node
- What's next?

In this step of the workflow you will learn how n8n structures data and how to add custom JavaScript code to perform calculations using the Code node. After this step, your workflow should look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.5.json)

The next step in Nathan's workflow is to calculate two values from the booked orders:

- The total number of booked orders
- The total value of all booked orders

To calculate data and add more functionality to your workflows you can use the Code node, which lets you write custom JavaScript code.

## About the Code node

The Code node has two operational **modes**, depending on how you want to process items:

- **Run Once for All Items** allows you to write code to process all input items at once, as a group.
- **Run Once for Each Item** executes your code once for each input item.

Learn more about how to use the [Code node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).

In n8n, the data that's passed between nodes is an array of objects with the following JSON structure:

1. (required) n8n stores the actual data within a nested `json` key. This property is required, but can be set to anything from an empty object (like `{}`) to arrays and deeply nested data. The code node automatically wraps the data in a `json` object and parent array (`[]`) if it's missing.
1. (optional) Binary data of item. Most items in n8n don't contain binary data.
1. (required) Arbitrary key name for the binary data.
1. (required) Base64-encoded binary data.
1. (optional) Should set if possible.
1. (optional) Should set if possible.
1. (optional) Should set if possible.

You can learn more about the expected format on the [n8n data structure](../../../../data/data-structure/) page.

## Configure the Code node

Now let's see how to accomplish Nathan's task using the Code node.

In your workflow, add a **Code node** connected to the `false` branch of the **If node**.

With the Code node window open, configure these parameters:

- **Mode**: Select **Run Once for All Items**.

- **Language**: Select **JavaScript**.

Using Python in code nodes

While we use JavaScript below, you can also use Python in the Code node. To learn more, refer to the [Code node](../../../../code/code-node/) documentation.

- Copy the Code below and paste it into the **Code** box to replace the existing code:

Notice the format in which we return the results of the calculation:

If you don't use the correct data structure, you will get an error message: `Error: Always an Array of items has to be returned!`

Now select **Execute step** and you should see the following results:

**Nathan 🙋**: Wow, the Code node is powerful! This means that if I have some basic JavaScript skills I can power up my workflows.

**You 👩‍🔧**: Yes! You can progress from no-code to low-code!

**Nathan 🙋**: Now, how do I send the calculations for the booked orders to my team's Discord channel?

**You 👩‍🔧**: There's an n8n node for that. I'll set it up in the next step.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
[
    {
   	 "json": { // (1)!
   		 "apple": "beets",
   		 "carrot": {
   			 "dill": 1
   		 }
   	 },
   	 "binary": { // (2)!
   		 "apple-picture": { // (3)!
   			 "data": "....", // (4)!
   			 "mimeType": "image/png", // (5)!
   			 "fileExtension": "png", // (6)!
   			 "fileName": "example.png", // (7)!
   		 }
   	 }
    },
    ...
]
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
let items = $input.all();
  let totalBooked = items.length;
  let bookedSum = 0;

  for (let i=0; i < items.length; i++) {
    bookedSum = bookedSum + items[i].json.orderPrice;
  }

  return [{ json: {totalBooked, bookedSum} }];
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
return [{ json: {totalBooked, bookedSum} }]
```

## Binary data

**URL:** llms-txt#binary-data

**Contents:**
- Enable filesystem mode
- Binary data pruning

Binary data is any file-type data, such as image files or documents generated or processed during the execution of a workflow.

## Enable filesystem mode

When handling binary data, n8n keeps the data in memory by default. This can cause crashes when working with large files.

To avoid this, change the `N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE` [environment variable](../../configuration/environment-variables/binary-data/) to `filesystem`. This causes n8n to save data to disk, instead of using memory.

If you're using queue mode, keep this to `default`. n8n doesn't support filesystem mode with queue mode.

## Binary data pruning

n8n executes binary data pruning as part of execution data pruning. Refer to [Execution data | Enable executions pruning](../execution-data/#enable-executions-pruning) for details.

If you configure multiple binary data modes, binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. Refer to [External storage](../external-storage/#usage) for details.

**URL:** llms-txt#customer.io-credentials

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Supported authentication methods
- Related resources
- Using API key
- Why you need a Tracking API Key and an App API Key

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes with Customer.io.

- [Customer.io](../../app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.customerio/)
- [Customer.io Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.customeriotrigger/)

Create a [Customer.io](https://customer.io/) account.

## Supported authentication methods

Refer to [Customer.io's summary API documentation](https://customer.io/docs/api/?api=journeys) for more information about the service.

For detailed API reference documentation for each API, refer to the [Track API documentation](https://customer.io/docs/api/track/) and the [App API documentation](https://customer.io/docs/api/app/).

To configure this credential, you'll need:

- A **Tracking API Key**: For use with the [Track API](https://customer.io/docs/api/track/) at `https://track.customer.io/api/v1/`. See the FAQs below for more details.
- Your **Region**: Customer.io uses different API subdomains depending on the region you select. Options include:
  - **Global region**: Keeps the default URLs for both APIs; for use in all non-EU countries/regions.
  - **EU region**: Adjusts the Track API subdomain to `track-eu` and the App API subdomain to `api-eu`; only use this if you are in the EU.
- A **Tracking Site ID**: Required with your **Tracking API Key**
- An **App API Key**: For use with the [App API](https://customer.io/docs/api/app/) at `https://api.customer.io/v1/api/`. See the FAQs below for more details.

Refer to the [Customer.io Finding and managing your API credentials documentation](https://customer.io/docs/accounts-and-workspaces/managing-credentials/) for instructions on creating both Tracking API and App API keys.

## Why you need a Tracking API Key and an App API Key

Customer.io has two different API endpoints and generates and stores the keys for each slightly differently:

- The [Track API](https://customer.io/docs/api/track/) at `https://track.customer.io/api/v1/`
- The [App API](https://customer.io/docs/api/app/) at `https://api.customer.io/v1/api/`

The Track API requires a Tracking Site ID; the App API doesn't.

Based on the operation you want to perform, n8n uses the correct API key and its corresponding endpoint.

## Community node verification guidelines

**URL:** llms-txt#community-node-verification-guidelines

**Contents:**
- Use the n8n-node tool
- Package source verification
- No external dependencies
- Proper documentation
- No access to environment variables or file system
- Follow n8n best practices
- Use English language only

Do you want n8n to verify your node?

Consider following these guidelines while building your node if you want to submit it for verification by n8n. Any user with verified community nodes enabled can discover and install verified nodes from n8n's nodes panel across all deployment types (self-hosted and n8n Cloud).

## Use the n8n-node tool

All verified community node authors should strongly consider using the [`n8n-node` tool](../../n8n-node/) to create and check their package. This helps n8n ensure quality and consistency by:

- Generating the expected package file structure
- Adding the required metadata and configuration to the `package.json` file
- Making it easy to lint your code against n8n's standards
- Allowing you to load your node in a local n8n instance for testing

## Package source verification

- Verify that your npm package repository URL matches the expected GitHub (or other platform) repository.
- Confirm that the package author / maintainer matches between npm and the repository.
- Confirm that the git link in npm works and that the repository is public.
- Make sure your package has proper documentation (README, usage examples, etc.).
- Make sure your package license is MIT.

## No external dependencies

- Ensure that your package does **not** include any external dependencies to keep it lightweight and easy to maintain.

## Proper documentation

- Provide clear documentation, whether it’s a **README** on GitHub or links to relevant **API documentation**.
- Include usage instructions, example workflows, and any necessary authentication details.

## No access to environment variables or file system

- The code **must not** interact with environment variables or attempt to read/write files.
- Pass all necessary data through node parameters.

## Follow n8n best practices

- Maintain a clear and consistent coding style.
- Use **TypeScript** and follow n8n's [**node development guidelines**](../../../overview/).
- Ensure proper error handling and validation.
- Make sure the linter passes (in other words, make sure running `npx @n8n/scan-community-package n8n-nodes-PACKAGE` passes).

## Use English language only

- Both the node interface and all documentation must be in **English** only.
- This includes parameter names, descriptions, help text, error messages and **README** content.

## Zep Vector Store node

**URL:** llms-txt#zep-vector-store-node

**Contents:**
- Node usage patterns
  - Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents
  - Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool
  - Use a retriever to fetch documents
  - Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions
- Node parameters
  - Operation Mode
  - Rerank Results
  - Insert Documents parameters
  - Get Many parameters

This node is deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.

Use the Zep Vector Store to interact with Zep vector databases. You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain), or connect it directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to use as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Zep Vector Store node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/zep/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Zep Vector Store integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/zep-vector-store/) page.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the Zep Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents

You can use the Zep Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Zep Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (the example uses Supabase, but the pattern is the same).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the Zep Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Zep Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Zep Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Zep Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the example uses Pinecone, but the pattern in the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Zep Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Zep Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Zep Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (this example uses Supabase, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Zep Vector store.

This Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt is embedded and used for similarity search. The node returns the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents

Use insert documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (as Tool for AI Agent)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Insert Documents parameters

- **Collection Name**: Enter the collection name to store the data in.

### Get Many parameters

- **Collection Name**: Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from.
- **Prompt**: Enter the search query.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters

- **Collection Name**: Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters

- **Name**: The name of the vector store.
- **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
- **Collection Name**: Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Embedding Dimensions

Must be the same when embedding the data and when querying it.

This sets the size of the array of floats used to represent the semantic meaning of a text document.

Available in the **Insert Documents** Operation Mode, enabled by default.

Disable this to configure your embeddings in Zep instead of in n8n.

Available in **Get Many** mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document.

This is an `AND` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.

When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.

**URL:** llms-txt#execution-data

**Contents:**
- Operations
- Data to Save
- Limitations
- Templates and examples

Use this node to save metadata for workflow executions. You can then search by this data in the **Executions** list.

You can retrieve custom execution data during workflow execution using the Code node. Refer to [Custom executions data](../../../../workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/) for more information.

Custom executions data is available on:

- Cloud: Pro, Enterprise
- Self-Hosted: Enterprise, registered Community

## Set 60 as the maximum number of log files to be kept

**URL:** llms-txt#set-60-as-the-maximum-number-of-log-files-to-be-kept

**Contents:**
  - Log levels
- Development
  - Implementation details
  - Adding logs
- Front-end logs

export N8N_LOG_FILE_COUNT_MAX=60

// You have to import the LoggerProxy. We rename it to Logger to make it easier

import {
	LoggerProxy as Logger
} from 'n8n-workflow';

// Info-level logging of a trigger function, with workflow name and workflow ID as additional metadata properties

Logger.info(`Polling trigger initiated for workflow "${workflow.name}"`, {workflowName: workflow.name, workflowId: workflow.id});
```

When creating new loggers, some useful standards to keep in mind are:

- Craft log messages to be as human-readable as possible. For example, always wrap names in quotes.
- Duplicating information in the log message and metadata, like workflow name in the above example, can be useful as messages are easier to search and metadata enables easier filtering.
- Include multiple IDs (for example, `executionId`, `workflowId`, and `sessionId`) throughout all logs.
- Use node types instead of node names (or both) as this is more consistent, and so easier to search.

As of now, front-end logs aren't available. Using `Logger` or `LoggerProxy` would yield errors in the `editor-ui` package. This functionality will get implemented in the future versions.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
### Log levels

n8n uses standard log levels to report:

- `silent`: outputs nothing at all
- `error`: outputs only errors and nothing else
- `warn`: outputs errors and warning messages
- `info`: contains useful information about progress
- `debug`: the most verbose output. n8n outputs a lot of information to help you debug issues.

## Development

During development, adding log messages is a good practice. It assists in debugging errors. To configure logging for development, follow the guide below.

### Implementation details

n8n uses the `LoggerProxy` class, located in the `workflow` package. Calling the `LoggerProxy.init()` by passing in an instance of `Logger`, initializes the class before the usage.

The initialization process happens only once. The [`start.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/src/commands/start.ts) file already does this process for you. If you are creating a new command from scratch, you need to initialize the `LoggerProxy` class.

Once the `Logger` implementation gets created in the `cli` package, it can be obtained by calling the `getInstance` convenience method from the exported module.

Check the [start.ts](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/src/commands/start.ts) file to learn more about how this process works.

### Adding logs

Once the `LoggerProxy` class gets initialized in the project, you can import it to any other file and add logs.

Convenience methods are provided for all logging levels, so new logs can be added whenever needed using the format `Logger.<logLevel>('<message>', ...meta)`, where `meta` represents any additional properties desired beyond `message`.

In the example above, we use the standard log levels described [above](#log-levels). The `message` argument is a string, and `meta` is a data object.

## Cohere Chat Model node

**URL:** llms-txt#cohere-chat-model-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
- Node options
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

Use the Cohere Chat Model node to access Cohere's large language models for conversational AI and text generation tasks.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Cohere Chat Model node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/cohere/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Model**: Select the model which will generate the completion. n8n dynamically loads available models from the Cohere API. Learn more in the [Cohere model documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/models#command).

- **Sampling Temperature**: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.
- **Max Retries**: Enter the maximum number of times to retry a request.

## LangChain Code node

**URL:** llms-txt#langchain-code-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Add Code
  - Inputs
  - Outputs
- Node inputs and outputs configuration
- Built-in methods
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

Use the LangChain Code node to import LangChain. This means if there is functionality you need that n8n hasn't created a node for, you can still use it. By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors you can use it as a normal node, root node or sub-node.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters, guidance on configuring the node, and links to more resources.

Not available on Cloud

This node is only available on self-hosted n8n.

Add your custom code. Choose either **Execute** or **Supply Data** mode. You can only use one mode.

Unlike the [Code node](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/), the LangChain Code node doesn't support Python.

- **Execute**: use the LangChain Code node like n8n's own Code node. This takes input data from the workflow, processes it, and returns it as the node output. This mode requires a main input and output. You must create these connections in **Inputs** and **Outputs**.
- **Supply Data**: use the LangChain Code node as a sub-node, sending data to a root node. This uses an output other than main.

By default, you can't load built-in or external modules in this node. Self-hosted users can [enable built-in and external modules](../../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/).

Choose the input types.

The main input is the normal connector found in all n8n workflows. If you have a main input and output set in the node, **Execute** code is required.

Choose the output types.

The main output is the normal connector found in all n8n workflows. If you have a main input and output set in the node, **Execute** code is required.

## Node inputs and outputs configuration

By configuring the LangChain Code node connectors (inputs and outputs) you can use it as an app node, root node or sub-node.

  - Array Format in Query Parameters
  - Batching

The HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes in n8n. It allows you to make HTTP requests to query data from any app or service with a REST API. You can use the HTTP Request node a regular node or attached to an [AI agent](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/) to use as a [tool](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/).

When using this node, you're creating a REST API call. You need some understanding of basic API terminology and concepts.

There are two ways to create an HTTP request: configure the [node parameters](#node-parameters) or [import a curl command](#import-curl-command).

Refer to [HTTP Request credentials](../../credentials/httprequest/) for guidance on setting up authentication.

Select the method to use for the request:

- DELETE
- GET
- HEAD
- OPTIONS
- PATCH
- POST
- PUT

Enter the endpoint you want to use.

n8n recommends using the **Predefined Credential Type** option when it's available. It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.

#### Predefined credentials

Credentials for integrations supported by n8n, including both built-in and community nodes. Use **Predefined Credential Type** for custom operations without extra setup. Refer to [Custom API operations](../../../custom-operations/) for more information.

#### Generic credentials

Credentials for integrations not supported by n8n. You'll need to manually configure the authentication process, including specifying the required API endpoints, necessary parameters, and the authentication method.

You can select one of the following methods:

- Basic auth
- Custom auth
- Digest auth
- Header auth
- OAuth1 API
- OAuth2 API
- Query auth

Refer to [HTTP request credentials](../../credentials/httprequest/) for more information on setting up each credential type.

### Send Query Parameters

Query parameters act as filters on HTTP requests. If the API you're interacting with supports them and the request you're making needs a filter, turn this option on.

**Specify your query parameters** using one of the available options:

- **Using Fields Below**: Enter **Name**/**Value** pairs of **Query Parameters**. To enter more query parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**. The name is the name of the field you're filtering on, and the value is the filter value.
- **Using JSON**: Enter **JSON** to define your query parameters.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

Use this parameter to send headers with your request. Headers contain metadata or context about your request.

**Specify Headers** using one of the available options:

- **Using Fields Below**: Enter **Name**/**Value** pairs of **Header Parameters**. To enter more header parameter name/value pairs, select **Add Parameter**. The name is the header you wish to set, and the value is the value you want to pass for that header.
- **Using JSON**: Enter **JSON** to define your header parameters.

Refer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.

### Array Format in Query Parameters

This option is only available when you turn on **Send Query Parameters**.

Use this option to control the format for arrays included in query parameters. Choose from these options:

- **No Brackets**: Arrays will format as the name=value for each item in the array, for example: `foo=bar&foo=qux`.
- **Brackets Only**: The node adds square brackets after each array name, for example: `foo[]=bar&foo[]=qux`.
- **Brackets with Indices**: The node adds square brackets with an index value after each array name, for example: `foo[0]=bar&foo[1]=qux`.

Refer to your service's API documentation for guidance on which option to use.

Control how to batch large numbers of input items:

- **Items per Batch**: Enter the number of input items to include in each batch.
- **Batch Interval**: Enter the time to wait between each batch of requests in milliseconds. Enter 0 for no batch interval.

### Ignore SSL Issues

By default, n8n only downloads the response if SSL certificate validation succeeds. If you'd like to download the response even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn this option on.

### Lowercase Headers

Choose whether to lowercase header names (turned on, default) or not (turned off).

Choose whether to follow redirects (turned on by default) or not (turned off). If turned on, enter the maximum number of redirects the request should follow in **Max Redirects**.

Use this option to set some details about the expected API response, including:

- **Include Response Headers and Status**: By default, the node returns only the body. Turn this option on to return the full response (headers and response status code) as well as the body.
- **Never Error**: By default, the node returns success only when the response returns with a 2xx code. Turn this option on to return success regardless of the code returned.
- **Response Format**: Select the format in which the data gets returned. Choose from:
  - **Autodetect** (default): The node detects and formats the response based on the data returned.
  - **File**: Select this option to put the response into a file. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in **Put Output in Field**.
  - **JSON**: Select this option to format the response as JSON.
  - **Text**: Select this option to format the response as plain text. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in **Put Output in Field**.

Use this option to paginate results, useful for handling query results that are too big for the API to return in a single call.

Inspect the API data first

Some options for pagination require knowledge of the data returned by the API you're using. Before setting up pagination, either check the API documentation, or do an API call without pagination, to see the data it returns.

Understand pagination

Pagination means splitting a large set of data into multiple pages. The amount of data on each page depends on the limit you set.

For example, you make an API call to an endpoint called `/users`. The API wants to send back information on 300 users, but this is too much data for the API to send in one response.

If the API supports pagination, you can incrementally fetch the data. To do this, you call `/users` with a pagination limit, and a page number or URL to tell the API which page to send. In this example, say you use a limit of 10, and start from page 0. The API sends the first 10 users in its response. You then call the API again, increasing the page number by 1, to get the next 10 results.

Configure the pagination settings:

- **Pagination Mode**:
  - **Off**: Turn off pagination.
  - **Update a Parameter in Each Request**: Use this when you need to dynamically set parameters for each request.
  - **Response Contains Next URL**: Use this when the API response includes the URL of the next page. Use an expression to set **Next URL**.

For example setups, refer to [HTTP Request node cookbook | Pagination](../../../../code/cookbook/http-node/pagination/).

n8n provides built-in variables for working with HTTP node requests and responses when using pagination:

| Variable     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$pageCount` | The pagination count. Tracks how many pages the node has fetched.                                                                                                                            |
| `$request`   | The request object sent by the HTTP node.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `$response`  | The response object from the HTTP call. Includes `$response.body`, `$response.headers`, and `$response.statusCode`. The contents of `body` and `headers` depend on the data sent by the API. |

Different APIs implement pagination in different ways. Check the API documentation for the API you're using for details. You need to find out things like:

- Does the API provide the URL for the next page?
- Are there API-specific limits on page size or page number?
- The structure of the data that the API returns.

Use this option if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.

Enter the **Proxy** the request should use. This takes precedence over global settings defined with the [`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, or `ALL_PROXY` environment variables](../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/).

Use this option to set how long the node should wait for the server to send response headers (and start the response body). The node aborts requests that exceed this value for the initial response.

Enter the **Timeout** time to wait in milliseconds.

The following options are only available when attached to an [AI agent](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/) as a [tool](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/).

### Optimize Response

Whether to optimize the tool response to reduce the amount of data passed to the LLM. Optimizing the response can reduce costs and can help the LLM ignore unimportant details, often leading to better results.

When optimizing responses, you select an expected response type, which determines other options you can configure. The supported response types are:

When expecting a **JSON** response, you can configure which parts of the JSON data to use as a response with the following choices:

- **Field Containing Data**: This field identifies a specific part of the JSON object that contains your relevant data. You can leave this blank to use the entire response.
- **Include Fields**: This is how you choose which fields you want in your response object. There are three choices:
  - **All**: Include all fields in the response object.
  - **Selected**: Include only the fields specified below.
    - **Fields**: A comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.
  - **Exclude**: Include all fields *except* the fields specified below.
    - **Fields**: A comma-separated list of fields to exclude from the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.

When expecting **HTML**, you can identify the part of an HTML document relevant to the LLM and optimize the response with the following options:

- **Selector (CSS)**: A specific element or element type to include in the response HTML. Uses the `body` element by default.
- **Return Only Content**: Whether to strip HTML tags and attributes from the response, leaving only the actual content. This uses fewer tokens and may be easier for the model to understand.
  - **Elements To Omit**: A comma-separated list of CSS selectors to exclude when extracting content.
- **Truncate Response**: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.
  - **Max Response Characters**: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.

When expecting a generic **Text** response, you can optimize the results with the following options:

- **Truncate Response**: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.
  - **Max Response Characters**: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.

## Import curl command

[curl](https://curl.se/) is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.

You can use curl to call REST APIs. If the API documentation of the service you want to use provides curl examples, you can copy them out of the documentation and into n8n to configure the HTTP Request node.

Import a curl command:

1. From the HTTP Request node's **Parameters** tab, select **Import cURL**. The **Import cURL command** modal opens.
1. Paste your curl command into the text box.
1. Select **Import**. n8n loads the request configuration into the node fields. This overwrites any existing configuration.

## Processing different data types

**URL:** llms-txt#processing-different-data-types

**Contents:**
- HTML and XML data
  - HTML Exercise
  - XML Exercise
- Date, time, and interval data
  - Date Exercise
- Binary data
  - Binary Exercise 1
  - Binary Exercise 2

In this chapter, you will learn how to process different types of data using [n8n core nodes](../../../workflows/components/nodes/).

You're most likely familiar with HTML and XML.

HTML is a markup language used to describe the structure and semantics of a web page. XML looks similar to HTML, but the tag names are different, as they describe the kind of data they hold.

If you need to process HTML or XML data in your n8n workflows, use the [**HTML node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/) or the [**XML node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/).

Use the **HTML node** to extract HTML content of a webpage by referencing CSS selectors. This is useful if you want to collect structured information from a website (web-scraping).

Let's get the title of the latest n8n blog post:

1. Use the **HTTP Request node** to make a GET request to the URL `https://blog.n8n.io/` (this endpoint requires no authentication).
1. Connect an **HTML node** and configure it to extract the title of the first blog post on the page.
   - Hint: If you're not familiar with CSS selectors or reading HTML, the CSS selector `.post .item-title a` should help!

1. Configure the HTTP Request node with the following parameters:
   - **Authentication**: None
   - **Request Method**: GET
   - **URL**: https://blog.n8n.io/ The result should look like this:

*Result of HTTP Request node*

2. Connect an **HTML node** to the **HTTP Request node** and configure the former's parameters:
   - **Operation**: Extract HTML Content
   - **Source Data**: JSON
   - **JSON Property**: data
   - **Extraction Values**:
     - **Key**: title
     - **CSS Selector**: `.post .item-title a`
     - **Return Value**: HTML

You can add more values to extract more data.

The result should look like this:

*Result of HTML Extract node*

Use the **XML node** to convert XML to JSON and JSON to XML. This operation is useful if you work with different web services that use either XML or JSON and need to get and submit data between them in the two formats.

In the [final exercise of Chapter 1](../chapter-1/#exercise_2), you used an **HTTP Request node** to make a request to the PokéAPI. In this exercise, we'll return to that same API but we'll convert the output to XML:

1. Add an **HTTP Request node** that makes the same request to the PokéAPI at `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon`.
1. Use the XML node to convert the JSON output to XML.

1. To get the pokemon from the PokéAPI, execute the **HTTP Request node** with the following parameters:
   - **Authentication**: None
   - **Request Method**: GET
   - **URL**: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon
1. Connect an **XML node** to it with the following parameters:
   - **Mode**: JSON to XML
   - **Property name**: data

The result should look like this:

*XML node (JSON to XML) – Table View*

To transform data the other way around, select the mode **XML to JSON**.

## Date, time, and interval data

Date and time data types include `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, and `YEAR`. The dates and times can be passed in different formats, for example:

- `DATE`: March 29 2022, 29-03-2022, 2022/03/29
- `TIME`: 08:30:00, 8:30, 20:30
- `DATETIME`: 2022/03/29 08:30:00
- `TIMESTAMP`: 1616108400 (Unix timestamp), 1616108400000 (Unix ms timestamp)
- `YEAR`: 2022, 22

There are a few ways you can work with dates and times:

- Use the [**Date & Time node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/) to convert date and time data to different formats and calculate dates.
- Use [**Schedule Trigger node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/) to schedule workflows to run at a specific time, interval, or duration.

Sometimes, you might need to pause the workflow execution. This might be necessary if you know that a service doesn't process the data instantly or it's slow to return all the results. In these cases, you don't want n8n to pass incomplete data to the next node.

If you run into situations like this, use the [**Wait node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) after the node that you want to delay. The **Wait node** pauses the workflow execution and will resume execution:

- At a specific time.
- After a specified time interval.
- On a webhook call.

Build a workflow that adds five days to an input date from the Customer Datastore node that you used before. Then, if the calculated date occurred after 1959, the workflow waits 1 minute before [setting](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) the calculated date as a value. The workflow should be triggered every 30 minutes.

1. Add the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** with the **Get All People** action selected. Return All.
1. Add the **Date & Time node** to Round Up the created Date from the datastore to End of Month. Output this to field new-date. Include all input fields.
1. Add the **If node** to check if that new rounded date is after `1960-01-01 00:00:00`.
1. Add the **Wait node** to the True output of that node and set it to wait for one minute.
1. Add the **Edit Fields (Set) node** to set a new field called outputValue to a String containing new-date. Include all input fields.
1. Add the **Schedule Trigger node** at the beginning of the workflow to trigger it every 30 minutes. (You can keep the [Manual Trigger node](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger/) for testing!)

1. Add the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** with the **Get All People** action selected.
   - Select the option to **Return All**.
1. Add a **Date & Time node** connected to the Customer Datastore node. Select the option to **Round a Date**.
   - Add the `created` date as the **Date** to round.
   - Select `Round Up` as the **Mode** and `End of Month` as the **To**.
   - Set the **Output Field Name** as `new-date`.
   - In **Options**, select **Add Option** and use the control to **Include Input Fields**
1. Add an **If node** connected to the **Date & Time node**.
   - Add the new-date field as the first part of the condition.
   - Set the comparison to **Date &Time > is after**
   - Add `1960-01-01 00:00:00` as the second part of the expression. (This should produce 3 items in the True Branch and 2 items in the False Branch)
1. Add a **Wait node** to the True output of the **If node**.
   - Set **Resume** to `After Time interval`.
   - Set **Wait Amount** to `1.00`.
   - Set **Wait Unit** to `Minutes`.
1. Add an **Edit Fields (Set) node** to the **Wait node**.
   - Use either JSON or Manual Mapping **Mode**.
   - Set a new field called `outputValue` to be the value of the new-date field.
   - Select the option to **Include Other Input Fields** and include **All** fields.
1. Add a **Schedule Trigger node** at the beginning of the workflow.
   - Set the **Trigger Interval** to use `Minutes`.
   - Set the **Minutes Between Triggers** to 30.
   - To test your schedule, be sure to activate the workflow.
   - Be sure to connect this node to the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** you began with!

The workflow should look like this:

*Workflow for transforming dates*

To check the configuration of each node, you can copy the JSON code of this workflow and either paste it into the Editor UI or save it as a file and import from file into a new workflow. See [Export and import workflows](../../../workflows/export-import/) for more information.

Up to now, you have mainly worked with text data. But what if you want to process data that's not text, like images or PDF files? These types of files are represented in the binary numeral system, so they're considered binary data. In this form, binary data doesn't offer you useful information, so you'll need to convert it into a readable form.

In n8n, you can process binary data with the following nodes:

- [HTTP Request](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to request and send files from/to web resources and APIs.
- [Read/Write Files from Disk](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.
- [Convert to File](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to take input data and output it as a file.
- [Extract From File](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.

Reading and writing files is only available on self-hosted n8n

Reading and writing files to disk isn't available on n8n Cloud. You'll read and write to the machine where you installed n8n. If you run n8n in Docker, your command runs in the n8n container and not the Docker host. The Read/Write Files From Disk node looks for files relative to the n8n install path. n8n recommends using absolute file paths to prevent any errors.

To read or write a binary file, you need to write the path (location) of the file in the node's `File(s) Selector` parameter (for the Read operation) or in the node's `File Path and Name` parameter (for the Write operation).

Naming the right path

The file path looks slightly different depending on how you are running n8n:

- npm: `~/my_file.json`
- n8n cloud / Docker: `/tmp/my_file.json`

### Binary Exercise 1

For our first binary exercise, let's convert a PDF file to JSON:

1. Make an HTTP request to get this PDF file: `https://media.kaspersky.com/pdf/Kaspersky_Lab_Whitepaper_Anti_blocker.pdf.`
1. Use the **Extract From File node** to convert the file from binary to JSON.

In the **HTTP Request node**, you should see the PDF file, like this:

*HTTP Request node to get PDF*

When you convert the PDF from binary to JSON using the **Extract From File node**, the result should look like this:

*Extract From File node*

To check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:

### Binary Exercise 2

For our second binary exercise, let's convert some JSON data to binary:

1. Make an HTTP request to the Poetry DB API `https://poetrydb.org/random/1`.
1. Convert the returned data from JSON to binary using the **Convert to File node**.
1. Write the new binary file data to the machine where n8n is running using the **Read/Write Files From Disk node**.
1. To check that it worked out, use the **Read/Write Files From Disk node** to read the generated binary file.

The workflow for this exercise looks like this:

*Workflow for moving JSON to binary data*

To check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:

## Google Drive node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#google-drive-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Google hasn't verified this app
- Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized
- Google Drive OAuth error
- Get recent files from Google Drive

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Google Drive node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Google hasn't verified this app

If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning **Google hasn't verified this app**. To avoid this:

- If your app **User Type** is **Internal**, create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate.
- If your app **User Type** is **External**, you can add your email to the list of testers for the app: go to the [**Audience**](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience) page and add the email you're signing in with to the list of **Test users**.

If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in [Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/reference/errors/authorization#google_hasnt_verified_this_app).

## Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized

For Google Cloud apps with **Publishing status** set to **Testing** and **User type** set to **External**, consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to [Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615?hl=en#zippy=%2Ctesting) for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal.

## Google Drive OAuth error

If using the OAuth authentication method, you may see an error indicating that you can't sign in because the app doesn't meet Google's expectations for keeping apps secure.

Most often, the actual cause of this issue is that the URLs don't match between Google's OAuth configuration and n8n. To avoid this, start by reviewing any links included in Google's error message. This will contain details about the exact error that occurred.

If you are self-hostin n8n, check the n8n configuration items used to construct external URLs. Verify that the [`N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`](../../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) and [`WEBHOOK_URL`](../../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/) environment variables use fully qualified domains.

## Get recent files from Google Drive

To retrieve recent files from Google Drive, you need to sort files by modification time. To do this, you need to search for existing files and retrieve their modification times. Next you can sort the files to find the most recent file and use another Google Drive node target the file by ID.

The process looks like this:

1. Add a **Google Drive** node to your canvas.
1. Select the **File/Folder** resource and the **Search** operation.
1. Enable **Return All** to sort through all files.
1. Set the **What to Search** filter to **Files**.
1. In the **Options**, set the **Fields** to **All**.
1. Connect a **Sort** node to the output of the **Google Drive** node.
1. Choose **Simple** sort type.
1. Enter `modifiedTime` as the **Field Name** in the **Fields To Sort By** section.
1. Choose **Descending** sort order.
1. Add a **Limit** node to the output of the **Sort** node.
1. Set **Max Items** to **1** to keep the most recent file.
1. Connect another **Google Drive** node to the output of the **Limit** node.
1. Select **File** as the **Resource** and the operation of your choice.
1. In the **File** selection, choose **By ID**.
1. Select **Expression** and enter `{{ $json.id }}` as the expression.

## Create a workflow

**URL:** llms-txt#create-a-workflow

**Contents:**
- Create a workflow
- Run workflows manually
- Run workflows automatically

A [workflow](../../glossary/#workflow-n8n) is a collection of nodes connected together to automate a process. You build workflows on the [workflow canvas](../../glossary/#canvas-n8n).

1. Select the **button** in the upper-left corner of the side menu. Select workflow.
1. If your n8n instance supports projects, you'll also need to choose whether to create the workflow inside your **personal space** or a specific **project** you have access to. If you're using the community version, you'll always create workflows inside your personal space.
1. Get started by adding a trigger node: select **Add first step...**

1. Select the **create** button in the upper-right corner from either the **Overview** page or a specific **project**. Select workflow.
1. If you're doing this from the **Overview** page, you'll create the workflow inside your personal space. If you're doing this from inside a project, you'll create the workflow inside that specific project.
1. Get started by adding a trigger node: select **Add first step...**

If it's your first time building a workflow, you may want to use the [quickstart guides](../../try-it-out/) to quickly try out n8n features.

## Run workflows manually

You may need to run your workflow manually when building and testing, or if your workflow doesn't have a trigger node.

To run manually, select **Execute Workflow**.

## Run workflows automatically

All new workflows are inactive by default.

You need to activate workflows that start with a trigger node or Webhook node so that they can run automatically. When a workflow is inactive, you must run it manually.

To activate or deactivate your workflow, open your workflow and toggle **Inactive** / **Active**.

Once a workflow is active, it runs whenever its trigger conditions are met.

## Wait

**URL:** llms-txt#wait

**Contents:**
- Operations
  - After Time Interval
  - At Specified Time
  - On Webhook Call
  - On Form Submitted
- Templates and examples
- Time-based operations

Use the Wait node pause your workflow's execution. When the workflow pauses it offloads the execution data to the database. When the resume condition is met, the workflow reloads the data and the execution continues.

The Wait node can **Resume** on the following conditions:

- [**After Time Interval**](#after-time-interval): The node waits for a certain amount of time.
- [**At Specified Time**](#at-specified-time): The node waits until a specific time.
- [**On Webhook Call**](#on-webhook-call): The node waits until it receives an HTTP call.
- [**On Form Submitted**](#on-form-submitted): The node waits until it receives a form submission.

Refer to the more detailed sections below for more detailed instructions.

### After Time Interval

Wait for a certain amount of time.

This parameter includes two more fields:

- **Wait Amount**: Enter the amount of time to wait.
- **Wait Unit**: Select the unit of measure for the **Wait Amount**. Choose from:
  - **Seconds**
  - **Minutes**
  - **Hours**
  - **Days**

Refer to [Time-based operations](#time-based-operations) for more detail on how these intervals work and the timezone used.

### At Specified Time

Wait until a specific date and time to continue. Use the date and time picker to set the **Date and Time**.

Refer to [Time-based operations](#time-based-operations) for more detail on the timezone used.

This parameter enables your workflows to resume when the Wait node receives an HTTP call.

The webhook URL that resumes the execution when called is generated at runtime. The Wait node provides the `$execution.resumeUrl` variable so that you can reference and send the yet-to-be-generated URL wherever needed, for example to a third-party service or in an email.

When the workflow executes, the Wait node generates the resume URL and the webhook(s) in your workflow using the `$execution.resumeUrl`. This generated URL is unique to each execution, so your workflow can contain multiple Wait nodes and as the webhook URL is called it will resume each Wait node sequentially.

For this **Resume** style, set more parameters listed below.

Select if and how incoming resume-webhook-requests to `$execution.resumeUrl` should be authenticated. Options include:

- **Basic Auth**: Use basic authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Basic Auth** to use.
- **Header Auth**: Use header authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Header Auth** to use.
- **JWT Auth**: Use JWT authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for JWT Auth** to use.
- **None**: Don't use authentication.

Refer to the [Webhook node | Authentication documentation](../n8n-nodes-base.webhook/#supported-authentication-methods) for more information on each auth type.

Select the HTTP method the webhook should use. Refer to the [Webhook node | HTTP Method documentation](../n8n-nodes-base.webhook/#http-method) for more information.

Enter the Response Code the webhook should return. You can use common codes or enter a custom code.

Set when and how to respond to the webhook from these options:

- **Immediately**: Respond as soon as the node executes.
- **When Last Node Finishes**: Return the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow. If you select this option, also set:
  - **Response Data**: Select what data should be returned and what format to use. Options include:
    - **All Entries**: Returns all the entries of the last node in an array.
    - **First Entry JSON**: Return the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.
    - **First Entry Binary**: Return the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.
    - **No Response Body**: Return with no body.
- **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: Respond as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.

Set whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off). If turned on, also set:

- **Limit Type**: Select what type of limit to enforce from these options:
  - **After Time Interval**: Wait for a certain amount of time.
    - Enter the limit's **Amount** of time.
    - Select the limit's **Unit** of time.
  - **At Specified Time**: Wait until a specific date and time to resume.
    - **Max Date and Time**: Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.

#### On Webhook Call options

- **Binary Property**: Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to. This option's only relevant if binary data is received.
- **Ignore Bots**: Set whether to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers (turned on) or not (turned off).
- **IP(s) Whitelist**: Enter IP addresses here to limit who (or what) can invoke the webhook URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IPs outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook URL.
- **No Response Body**: Set whether n8n should send a body in the response (turned off) or prevent n8n from sending a body in the response (turned on).
- **Raw Body**: Set whether to return the body in a raw format like JSON or XML (turned on) or not (turned off).
- **Response Data**: Enter any custom data you want to send in the response.
- **Response Headers**: Send more headers in the webhook response. Refer to [MDN Web Docs | Response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) to learn more about response headers.
- **Webhook Suffix**: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated `$resumeWebhookUrl` won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.

#### On Webhook Call limitations

There are some limitations to keep in mind when using On Webhook Call:

- Partial executions of your workflow changes the `$resumeWebhookUrl`, so be sure that the node sending this URL to your desired third-party runs in the same execution as the Wait node.

### On Form Submitted

Wait for a form submission before continuing. Set up these parameters:

Enter the title to display at the top of the form.

#### Form Description

Enter a form description to display beneath the title. This description can help prompt the user on how to complete the form.

Set up each field you want to appear on your form using these parameters:

- **Field Label**: Enter the field label you want to appear in the form.
- **Field Type**: Select the type of field to display in the form. Choose from:
  - **Date**
  - **Dropdown List**: Enter each dropdown options in the **Field Options**.
    - **Multiple Choice**: Select whether the user can select a single dropdown option (turned off) or multiple dropdown options (turned on)
  - **Number**
  - **Password**
  - **Text**
  - **Textarea**
- **Required Field**: Set whether the user must complete this field in order to submit the form (turned on) or if the user can submit the form without completing it (turned off).

Set when to respond to the form submission. Choose from:

- **Form Is Submitted**: Respond as soon as this node receives the form submission.
- **Workflow Finishes**: Respond when the last node of this workflow finishes.
- **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: Respond when the [Respond to Webhook](../n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node executes.

Set whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off).

If turned on, also set: * **Limit Type**: Select what type of limit to enforce from these options: * **After Time Interval**: Wait for a certain amount of time. * Enter the limit's **Amount** of time. * Select the limit's **Unit** of time. * **At Specified Time**: Wait until a specific date and time to resume. * **Max Date and Time**: Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.

#### On Form Response options

- **Form Response**: Choose how and what you want the form to **Respond With** from these options:
  - **Form Submitted Text**: The form displays whatever text is entered in **Text to Show** after a user fills out the form. Use this option if you want to display a confirmation message.
  - **Redirect URL**: The form will redirect the user to the **URL to Redirect to** after they fill out the form. This must be a valid URL.
- **Webhook Suffix**: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated `$resumeWebhookUrl` won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.

## Time-based operations

For the time-based resume operations, note that:

- For wait times less than 65 seconds, the workflow doesn't offload execution data to the database. Instead, the process continues to run and the execution resumes after the specified interval passes.
- The n8n server time is always used regardless of the timezone setting. Workflow timezone settings, and any changes made to them, don't affect the Wait node interval or specified time.

## Designing the Workflow

**URL:** llms-txt#designing-the-workflow

Now that we know what Nathan wants to automate, let's consider the steps he needs to take to achieve his goals:

1. Get the relevant data (order id, order status, order value, employee name) from the data warehouse
1. Filter the orders by their status (Processing or Booked)
1. Calculate the total value of all the Booked orders
1. Notify the team members about the Booked orders in the company's Discord channel
1. Insert the details about the Processing orders in Airtable for follow-up
1. Schedule this workflow to run every Monday morning

Nathan's workflow involves sending data from the company's data warehouse to two external services:

Before that, the data has to be wrangled with general functions (conditional filtering, calculation, scheduling).

n8n provides integrations for all these steps, so Nathan's workflow in n8n would look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/finished.json)

You will build this workflow in eight steps:

1. [Getting data from the data warehouse](../chapter-5/chapter-5.1/)
1. [Inserting data into Airtable](../chapter-5/chapter-5.2/)
1. [Filtering orders](../chapter-5/chapter-5.3/)
1. [Setting values for processing orders](../chapter-5/chapter-5.4/)
1. [Calculating booked orders](../chapter-5/chapter-5.5/)
1. [Notifying the team](../chapter-5/chapter-5.6/)
1. [Scheduling the workflow](../chapter-5/chapter-5.7/)
1. [Activating and examining the workflow](../chapter-5/chapter-5.8/)

To build this workflow, you will need the credentials found in the email you received from n8n when you signed up for this course. If you haven't signed up already, you can do it [here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/PDEMrevI?typeform-source=127.0.0.1). If you haven't received a confirmation email after signing up, [contact us](mailto:help@n8n.io).

## Anthropic Chat Model node

**URL:** llms-txt#anthropic-chat-model-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
- Node options
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

Use the Anthropic Chat Model node to use Anthropic's Claude family of chat models with conversational [agents](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Anthropic Chat Model node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/anthropic/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Model**: Select the model that generates the completion. Choose from:
  - **Claude**
  - **Claude Instant**

Learn more in the [Anthropic model documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/selecting-a-model).

- **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Enter the maximum number of tokens used, which sets the completion length.
- **Sampling Temperature**: Use this option to control the randomness of the sampling process. A higher temperature creates more diverse sampling, but increases the risk of hallucinations.
- **Top K**: Enter the number of token choices the model uses to generate the next token.
- **Top P**: Use this option to set the probability the completion should use. Use a lower value to ignore less probable options.

## Risks when using community nodes

**URL:** llms-txt#risks-when-using-community-nodes

**Contents:**
- Report bad community nodes
- Disable community nodes

Installing community nodes from npm means you are installing unverified code from a public source into your n8n instance. This has some risks.

- System security: community nodes have full access to the machine that n8n runs on, and can do anything, including malicious actions.
- Data security: any community node that you use has access to data in your workflows.
- Breaking changes: node developers may introduce breaking changes in new versions of their nodes. A breaking change is an update that breaks previous functionality. Depending on the node versioning approach that a node developer chooses, upgrading to a version with a breaking change could cause all workflows using the node to break. Be careful when upgrading your nodes.

n8n vets verified community nodes

In addition to publicly available community nodes from npm, n8n inspects some nodes and makes them available as [verified community node inside the nodes panel](../installation/verified-install/). These nodes have to meet a set of data and system security requirements for approval.

## Report bad community nodes

You can report bad community nodes to \[security@n8n.io\](mailto: security@n8n.io)

## Disable community nodes

If you are self-hosting n8n, you can disable community nodes by setting `N8N_COMMUNITY_PACKAGES_ENABLED` to `false`. On n8n cloud, visit the [Cloud Admin Panel](../../../manage-cloud/cloud-admin-dashboard/) and disable community nodes from there. See [troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/) for more information.

## Install private nodes

**URL:** llms-txt#install-private-nodes

**Contents:**
- Install your node in a Docker n8n instance
- Install your node in a global n8n instance

You can build your own nodes and install them in your n8n instance without publishing them on npm. This is useful for nodes that you create for internal use only at your company.

## Install your node in a Docker n8n instance

If you're running n8n using Docker, you need to create a Docker image with the node installed in n8n.

1. Create a Dockerfile and paste the code from [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/Dockerfile).

Your Dockerfile should look like this:

1. Compile your custom node code (`npm run build` if you are using nodes starter). Copy the **node** and **credential** folders from within the **dist** folder into your container's `~/.n8n/custom/` directory. This makes them available to Docker.

1. Download the [docker-entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/docker-entrypoint.sh) file, and place it in the same directory as your Dockerfile.

1. Build your Docker image:

You can now use your node in Docker.

## Install your node in a global n8n instance

If you've installed n8n globally, make sure that you install your node inside n8n. n8n will find the module and load it automatically.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
FROM node:16-alpine

   ARG N8N_VERSION

   RUN if [ -z "$N8N_VERSION" ] ; then echo "The N8N_VERSION argument is missing!" ; exit 1; fi

   # Update everything and install needed dependencies
   RUN apk add --update graphicsmagick tzdata git tini su-exec

   # Set a custom user to not have n8n run as root
   USER root

   # Install n8n and the packages it needs to build it correctly.
   RUN apk --update add --virtual build-dependencies python3 build-base ca-certificates && \
   	npm config set python "$(which python3)" && \
   	npm_config_user=root npm install -g full-icu n8n@${N8N_VERSION} && \
   	apk del build-dependencies \
   	&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root;


   # Install fonts
   RUN apk --no-cache add --virtual fonts msttcorefonts-installer fontconfig && \
   	update-ms-fonts && \
   	fc-cache -f && \
   	apk del fonts && \
   	find  /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/ -type l -exec unlink {} \; \
   	&& rm -rf /root /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/* && mkdir /root

   ENV NODE_ICU_DATA /usr/local/lib/node_modules/full-icu

   WORKDIR /data

   COPY docker-entrypoint.sh /docker-entrypoint.sh
   ENTRYPOINT ["tini", "--", "/docker-entrypoint.sh"]

   EXPOSE 5678/tcp
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
# Replace <n8n-version-number> with the n8n release version number. 
   # For example, N8N_VERSION=0.177.0
   docker build --build-arg N8N_VERSION=<n8n-version-number> --tag=customizedn8n .
```

## AI Agent node

**URL:** llms-txt#ai-agent-node

**Contents:**
- Templates and examples
- Related resources
- Common issues

An [AI agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) is an autonomous system that receives data, makes rational decisions, and acts within its environment to achieve specific goals. The AI agent's environment is everything the agent can access that isn't the agent itself. This agent uses external [tools](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) and APIs to perform actions and retrieve information. It can understand the capabilities of different tools and determine which tool to use depending on the task.

You must connect at least one tool [sub-node](../../sub-nodes/) to an AI Agent node.

Prior to version 1.82.0, the AI Agent had a setting for working as different agent types. This has now been removed and all AI Agent nodes work as a `Tools Agent` which was the recommended and most frequently used setting. If you're working with older versions of the AI Agent in workflows or templates, as long as they were set to 'Tools Agent', they should continue to behave as intended with the updated node.

## Node file structure

**URL:** llms-txt#node-file-structure

**Contents:**
- Required files and directories
- Modular structure
- Versioning
- Decide how many nodes to include in a package
- A best-practice example for programmatic nodes

Following best practices and standards in your node structure makes your node easier to maintain. It's helpful if other people need to work with the code.

The file and directory structure of your node depends on:

- Your node's complexity.
- Whether you use node versioning.
- How many nodes you include in the npm package.

n8n recommends using the [`n8n-node` tool](../../n8n-node/) to create the expected node file structure. You can customize the generated scaffolding as required to meet more complex needs.

## Required files and directories

Your node must include:

- A `package.json` file at the root of the project. Every npm module requires this.
- A `nodes` directory, containing the code for your node:
  - This directory must contain the [base file](../node-base-files/), in the format `<node-name>.node.ts`. For example, `MyNode.node.ts`.
  - n8n recommends including a [codex file](../node-codex-files/), containing metadata for your node. The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named `MyNode.node.ts`, the codex name is `MyNode.node.json`.
  - The `nodes` directory can contain other files and subdirectories, including directories for versions, and node code split across more than one file to create a modular structure.
- A `credentials` directory, containing your credentials code. This code lives in a single [credentials file](../credentials-files/). The filename format is `<node-name>.credentials.ts`. For example, `MyNode.credentials.ts`.

You can choose whether to place all your node's functionality in one file, or split it out into a base file and other modules, which the base file then imports. Unless your node is very simple, it's a best practice to split it out.

A basic pattern is to separate out operations. Refer to the [HttpBin starter node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/tree/master/nodes/HttpBin) for an example of this.

For more complex nodes, n8n recommends a directory structure. Refer to the [Airtable node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable) or [Microsoft Outlook node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Microsoft/Outlook) as examples.

- `actions`: a directory containing sub-directories that represent resources.
  - Each sub-directory should contain two types of files:
  - An index file with resource description (named either `<resourceName>.resource.ts` or `index.ts`)
  - Files for operations `<operationName>.operation.ts`. These files should have two exports: `description` of the operation and an `execute` function.
- `methods`: an optional directory dynamic parameters' functions.
- `transport`: a directory containing the communication implementation.

If your node has more than one version, and you're using full versioning, this makes the file structure more complex. You need a directory for each version, along with a base file that sets the default version. Refer to [Node versioning](../node-versioning/) for more information on working with versions, including types of versioning.

## Decide how many nodes to include in a package

There are two possible setups when building a node:

- One node in one npm package.
- More than one node in a single npm package.

n8n supports both approaches. If you include more than one node, each node should have its own directory in the `nodes` directory.

## A best-practice example for programmatic nodes

n8n's built-in [Airtable node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable) implements a modular structure and versioning, following recommended patterns.

## OpenAI Functions Agent node

**URL:** llms-txt#openai-functions-agent-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Prompt
  - Require Specific Output Format
- Node options
  - System Message
  - Max Iterations
  - Return Intermediate Steps
- Templates and examples
- Common issues

Use the OpenAI Functions Agent node to use an [OpenAI functions model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling). These are models that detect when a function should be called and respond with the inputs that should be passed to the function.

Refer to [AI Agent](../) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

You can use this agent with the [Chat Trigger](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) node. Attach a memory sub-node so that users can have an ongoing conversation with multiple queries. Memory doesn't persist between sessions.

OpenAI Chat Model required

You must use the [OpenAI Chat Model](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatopenai/) with this agent.

Configure the OpenAI Functions Agent using the following parameters.

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

- **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
- **Define below**: If you select this option, provide either static text or an expression for dynamic content to serve as the prompt in the **Prompt (User Message)** field.

### Require Specific Output Format

This parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of these output parsers to the node:

- [Auto-fixing Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/)
- [Item List Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparseritemlist/)
- [Structured Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

Refine the OpenAI Functions Agent node's behavior using these options:

If you'd like to send a message to the agent before the conversation starts, enter the message you'd like to send.

Use this option to guide the agent's decision-making.

Enter the number of times the model should run to try and generate a good answer from the user's prompt.

### Return Intermediate Steps

Select whether to include intermediate steps the agent took in the final output (turned on) or not (turned off).

This could be useful for further refining the agent's behavior based on the steps it took.

## Templates and examples

Refer to the main AI Agent node's [Templates and examples](../#templates-and-examples) section.

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](../common-issues/).

## Building a Mini-workflow

**URL:** llms-txt#building-a-mini-workflow

**Contents:**
- 1. Add a Manual Trigger node
- 2. Add the Hacker News node
- 3. Configure the Hacker News node
  - Parameters
  - Settings
- 4. Execute the node
  - Node executions
- 5. Save the workflow
- Summary

In this lesson, you will build a small [workflow](../../../glossary/#workflow-n8n) that gets 10 articles about automation from Hacker News. The process consists of five steps:

1. [Add a Manual Trigger node](#1-add-a-manual-trigger-node)
1. [Add the Hacker News node](#2-add-the-hacker-news-node)
1. [Configure the Hacker News node](#3-configure-the-hacker-news-node)
1. [Execute the node](#4-execute-the-node)
1. [Save the workflow](#5-save-the-workflow)

The finished workflow will look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-2.json)

## 1. Add a Manual Trigger node

Open the nodes panel (reminder: you can open this by selecting the **+** icon in the top right corner of the [canvas](../../../glossary/#canvas-n8n) or selecting `Tab` on your keyboard).

1. Search for the **Manual Trigger** node.
1. Select it when it appears in the search.

This will add the [Manual Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger/) node to your canvas, which allows you to run the workflow at any time by selecting the **Execute workflow** button.

For faster workflow creation, you can skip this step in the future. Adding any other node without a trigger will add the Manual Trigger node to the workflow.

In a real-world scenario, you would probably want to set up a schedule or some other [trigger](../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n) to run the workflow.

## 2. Add the Hacker News node

Select the **+** icon to the right of the Manual Trigger node to open the nodes panel.

1. Search for the **Hacker News** node.
1. Select it when it appears in the search.
1. In the **Actions** section, select **Get many items**.

n8n adds the node to your canvas and the node window opens to display its configuration details.

## 3. Configure the Hacker News node

When you add a new node to the Editor UI, the node is automatically activated. The node details will open in a window with several options:

- **Parameters**: Adjust parameters to refine and control the node's functionality.
- **Settings**: Adjust settings to control the node's design and executions.
- **Docs**: Open the n8n documentation for this node in a new window.

Parameters vs. Settings

- **Parameters** are different for each node, depending on its functionality.
- **Settings** are the same for all nodes.

We need to configure several parameters for the Hacker News node to make it work:

- **Resource**: All\
  This resource selects all data records (articles).
- **Operation**: Get Many\
  This operation fetches all the selected articles.
- **Limit**: 10\
  This parameter sets a limit to the number of results the Get Many operation returns.
- **Additional Fields** > **Add Field** > **Keyword**: automation\
  **Additional fields** are options that you can add to certain nodes to make your request more specific or filter the results. For this example, we want to get only articles that include the keyword "automation."

The configuration of the parameters for the Hacker News node should now look like this:

*Hacker News node parameters*

The **Settings** section includes several options for node design and executions. In this case, we'll configure only the final two settings, which set the node's appearance in the Editor UI canvas.

In the Hacker News node Settings, edit:

- **Notes**: Get the 10 latest articles.

It's often helpful to add a short description in the node about what it does. This is helpful for complex or shared workflows in particular!

- **Display note in flow?**: toggle to true\
  This option will display the Note under the node in the canvas.

The configuration of the settings for the Hacker News node should now look like this:

*Hacker News node settings*

You can rename the node with a name that's more descriptive for your use case. There are three ways to do this:

- Select the node you want to rename and at the same time press the F2 key on your keyboard.
- Double-click on the node to open the node window. Click on the name of the node in the top left corner of the window, rename it as you like, then click **Rename** to save the node under the new name.
- Right-click on the node and select the **Rename** option.

*Renaming a node from the keyboard*

To find the original node name (the type of node), open the node window and select **Settings**. The bottom of the page contains the node type and version.

## 4. Execute the node

Select the **Execute step** button in the node details window. You should see 10 results in the Output **Table** view.

*Results in Table view for the Hacker News node*

A node execution represents a run of that node to retrieve or process the specified data.

If a node executes successfully, a small green checkmark appears on top of the node in the canvas

*Successfully executed workflow*

If there are no problems with the parameters and everything works fine, the requested data displays in the node window in **Table**, **JSON**, and **Schema** format. You can switch between these views by selecting the one you want from the **Table | JSON | Schema** button at the top of the node window.

The **Table** view is the default. It displays the requested data in a table, where the rows are the records and the columns are the available attributes of those records.

Here's our Hacker News output in JSON view:

*Results in JSON view for the Hacker News node*

The node window displays more information about the node execution:

- Next to the **Output** title, notice a small icon (this will be a green checkmark if the node execution succeeded). Beside it, there is an info icon. If you hover on it, you'll get two more pieces of information that can provide insights into the performance of each individual node in a workflow:
  - **Start Time**: When the node execution started.
  - **Execution Time**: How long it took for the node to return the results from the moment it started executing.
- Just below the **Output** title, you'll notice another piece of information: **10 items**. This field displays the number of items (records) that the node request returned. In this example, it's expected to be 10, since this is the limit we set in step 2. But if you don't set a limit, it's useful to see how many records are actually returned.

A red warning icon on a node means that the node has errors. This might happen if the node credentials are missing or incorrect or the node parameters aren't configured correctly.

## 5. Save the workflow

Once you're finished editing the node, select **Back to canvas** to return to the main canvas.

By default, your workflow is automatically saved as "My workflow."

For this lesson, rename the workflow to be "Hacker News workflow."

You can rename a workflow by clicking on the workflow's name at the top of the Editor UI.

Once you've renamed the workflow, be sure to save it.

There are two ways in which you can save a workflow:

- From the Canvas in Editor UI, click **Ctrl + S** or **Cmd + S** on your keyboard.
- Select the **Save** button in the top right corner of the Editor UI. You may need to leave the node editor first by clicking outside the dialog.

If you see a grey **Saved** text instead of the **Save** button, your workflow was automatically saved.

Congratulations, you just built your first workflow! In this lesson, you learned how to use actions in app nodes, configure their parameters and settings, and save and execute your workflow.

In the next lesson, you'll meet your new client, Nathan, who needs to automate his sales reporting work. You will build a more complex workflow for his use case, helping him become more productive at work.

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to activate your workflow and change the default workflow settings.

Activating a workflow means that it will run automatically every time a trigger node receives input or meets a condition. By default, all newly created workflows start deactivated.

To activate your workflow, set the **Inactive** toggle in the top navigation of the Editor UI to be **Activated**. Nathan's workflow will now be executed automatically every Monday at 9 AM:

## Workflow Executions

An execution represents a completed run of a workflow, from the first to the last node. n8n logs workflow executions, allowing you to see if the workflow succeeded or not. The execution log is useful for debugging your workflow and seeing at what stage it runs into issues.

To view the executions for a specific workflow, you can switch to the **Executions** tab when the workflow is open on the canvas. Use the **Editor** tab to swap back to the node editor.

To see the execution log for the entire n8n instance, in your Editor UI, select **Overview** and then select the **Executions** tab in the main panel.

The **Executions** window displays a table with the following information:

- **Name**: The name of the workflow
- **Started At**: The date and time when the workflow started
- **Status**: The status of the workflow (Waiting, Running, Succeeded, Cancelled, or Failed) and the amount of time it took the workflow to execute
- **Execution ID**: The ID of this workflow execution

Workflow execution status

You can filter the displayed **Executions** by workflow and by status (**Any Status**, **Failed**, **Cancelled**, **Running**, **Success**, or **Waiting**). The information displayed here depends on which executions you configure to save in the [**Workflow Settings**](../../../../workflows/settings/).

You can customize your workflows and executions, or overwrite some global default settings in [**Workflow Settings**](../../../../workflows/settings/).

Access these settings by selecting the three dots in the upper right corner of the Editor UI when the workflow is open on the canvas, then select **Settings**.

In the **Workflow Settings** window you can configure the following settings:

- **Execution Order**: Choose the execution logic for multi-branch workflows. You should leave this set to `v1` if you don't have workflows that rely on the legacy execution ordering.
- [**Error Workflow**](../../../../flow-logic/error-handling/): A workflow to run if the execution of the current workflow fails.
- **This workflow can be called by**: Workflows allowed to call this workflow using the [Execute Sub-workflow node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/).
- **Timezone**: The timezone to use in the current workflow. If not set, the global timezone. In particular, this setting is important for the [Schedule Trigger node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/), as you want to make sure that the workflow gets executed at the right time.
- **Save failed production executions**: If n8n should save the Execution data of the workflow when it fails. Default is to save.
- **Save successful production executions**: If n8n should save the Execution data of the workflow when it succeeds. Default is to save.
- **Save manual executions**: If n8n should save executions started from the Editor UI. Default is to save.
- **Save execution progress**: If n8n should save the execution data of each node. If set to Save, you can resume the workflow from where it stopped in case of an error, though keep in mind that this might make the execution slower. Default is to not save.
- **Timeout Workflow**: Whether to cancel a workflow execution after a specific period of time. Default is to not timeout.

**You 👩‍🔧**: That was it! Now you have a 7-node workflow that will run automatically every Monday morning. You don't have to worry about remembering to wrangle the data. Instead, you can start your week with more meaningful or exciting work.

**Nathan 🙋**: This workflow is incredibly helpful, thank you! Now, what's next for you?

**You 👩‍🔧**: I'd like to build more workflows, share them with others, and use some workflows built by other people.

- Collected data
- How collection works
- Opting out of data collection
  - Opt out of telemetry events
  - Opt out of checking for new versions of n8n
- Disable all connection to n8n servers
- Related resources

n8n collects some anonymous data from self-hosted n8n installations. Use the instructions below to opt out of data telemetry collection.

Refer to [Privacy | Data collection in self-hosted n8n](../../../privacy-security/privacy/#data-collection-in-self-hosted-n8n) for details on the data n8n collects.

## How collection works

Your n8n instance sends most data to n8n as the events that generate it occur. Workflow execution counts and an instance pulse are sent periodically (every 6 hours). These data types mostly fall into n8n telemetry collection.

## Opting out of data collection

n8n enables telemetry collection by default. To disable it, configure the following environment variables.

### Opt out of telemetry events

To opt out of telemetry events, set the `N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED` environment variable to false, for example:

### Opt out of checking for new versions of n8n

To opt out of checking for new versions of n8n, set the `N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED` environment variable to false, for example:

## Disable all connection to n8n servers

If you want to fully prevent all communication with n8n's servers, refer to [Isolate n8n](../../configuration/configuration-examples/isolation/).

Refer to [Deployment environment variables](../../configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) for more information on these environment variables.

Refer to [Configuration](../../configuration/configuration-methods/) for more information on setting environment variables.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
export N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
export N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false
```

## Workflow sharing

**URL:** llms-txt#workflow-sharing

**Contents:**
- Share a workflow
- View shared workflows
- Workflow roles and permissions
  - Permissions
- Node editing restrictions with unshared credentials

Available on Pro and Enterprise Cloud plans, and Enterprise self-hosted plans.

Workflow sharing allows you to share workflows between users of the same n8n instance.

Users can share workflows they created. Instance owners, and users with the admin role, can view and share all workflows in the instance. Refer to [Account types](../../user-management/account-types/) for more information about owners and admins.

1. Open the workflow you want to share.
1. Select **Share**.
1. In **Add users**, find and select the users you want to share with.
1. Select **Save**.

## View shared workflows

You can browse and search workflows on the **Workflows** list. The workflows in the list depend on the project:

- **Overview** lists all workflows you can access. This includes:
  - Your own workflows.
  - Workflows shared with you.
  - Workflows in projects you're a member of.
  - If you log in as the instance owner or admin: all workflows in the instance.
- Other projects: all workflows in the project.

## Workflow roles and permissions

There are two workflow roles: creator and editor. The creator is the user who created the workflow. Editors are other users with access to the workflow.

You can't change the workflow owner, except when deleting the user.

Workflow sharing allows editors to use all [credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n) used in the workflow. This includes credentials that aren't explicitly shared with them using [credential sharing](../../credentials/credential-sharing/).

| Permissions               | Creator | Editor |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| View workflow (read-only) |         |        |
| View executions           |         |        |
| Update (including tags)   |         |        |
| Run                       |         |        |
| Share                     |         |        |
| Export                    |         |        |
| Delete                    |         |        |

## Node editing restrictions with unshared credentials

Sharing in n8n works on the principle of least privilege. This means that if a user shares a workflow with you, but they don't share their credentials, you can't edit the nodes within the workflow that use those credentials. You can view and run the workflow, and edit nodes that don't use unshared credentials.

Refer to [Credential sharing](../../credentials/credential-sharing/) for guidance on sharing credentials.

**Contents:**
- Node operations: Triggers and Actions
- Core nodes
- Cluster nodes
- Credentials
- Community nodes

This section contains the [node](../../../glossary/#node-n8n) library: reference documentation for every built-in node in n8n, and their credentials.

## Node operations: Triggers and Actions

When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.

There are two types of operation:

- Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon .
- Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected.

Core nodes can be actions or [triggers](../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n). Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls.

[Cluster nodes](../../../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../../../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../../../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.

External services need a way to identify and authenticate users. This data can range from an API key over an email/password combination to a long multi-line private key. You can save these in n8n as [credentials](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n).

Nodes in n8n can then request that credential information. As another layer of security, only node types with specific access rights can access the credentials.

To make sure that the data is secure, it gets saved to the database encrypted. n8n uses a random personal encryption key, which it automatically generates on the first run of n8n and then saved under `~/.n8n/config`.

To learn more about creating, managing, and sharing credentials, refer to [Manage credentials](../../../credentials/).

n8n supports custom nodes built by the community. Refer to [Community nodes](../../community-nodes/installation/) for guidance on installing and using these nodes.

For help building your own custom nodes, and publish them to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), refer to [Creating nodes](../../creating-nodes/overview/) for more information.

Facebook Trigger credentials

If you want to create credentials for the [Facebook Trigger](../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/) node, follow the instructions mentioned in the [Facebook App credentials](../facebookapp/) documentation.

## Supported authentication methods

Refer to [Meta's Graph API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview) for more information about the service.

## Using app access token

To configure this credential, you'll need a [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) account and:

- An app **Access Token**

There are two steps in setting up your credential:

1. [Create a Meta app](#create-a-meta-app) with the products you need to access.
1. [Generate an App Access Token](#generate-an-app-access-token) for that app.

Refer to the detailed instructions below for each step.

### Create a Meta app

To create a Meta app:

1. Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and select **Create App**.
1. If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don’t want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**. The **Use cases** page opens.
1. Select the **Use case** that aligns with how you wish to use the Facebook Graph API. For example, for products in Meta's **Business** suite (like Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Marketing API, App Events, Audience Network, Commerce API, Fundraisers, Jobs, Threat Exchange, and Webhooks), select **Other**, then select **Next**.
1. Select **Business** and **Next**.
1. Complete the essential information:
   - Add an **App name**.
   - Add an **App contact email**.
   - Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it.
1. Select **Create app**.
1. The **Add products to your app** page opens.
1. Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.
1. Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app "Live.")
1. Select **Save changes**.
1. At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.
1. In the left menu, select **Add Product**.
1. The **Add products to your app** page appears. Select the products that make sense for your app and configure them.

Refer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.

For more information on the app modes and switching to **Live** mode, refer to [App Modes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes) and [Publish | App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release#app-types).

### Generate an App Access Token

Next, create an app access token to use with your n8n credential and the products you selected:

1. In a separate tab or window, open the [Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/).

1. Select the **Meta App** you just created in the **Access Token** section.

1. In **User or Page**, select **Get App Token**.

1. Select **Generate Access Token**.

1. The page prompts you to log in and grant access. Follow the on-screen prompts.

You may receive a warning that the app isn't available. Once you take an app live, there may be a few minutes' delay before you can generate an access token.

1. Copy the token and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**.

Refer to the Meta instructions for [Your First Request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/get-started#get-started) for more information on generating the token.

## Dealing with errors in workflows

**URL:** llms-txt#dealing-with-errors-in-workflows

**Contents:**
- Checking failed workflows
- Catching erroring workflows
  - Exercise
- Throwing exceptions in workflows

Sometimes you build a nice workflow, but it fails when you try to execute it. Workflow executions may fail for a variety of reasons, ranging from straightforward problems with incorrectly configuring a node or a failure in a third-party service to more mysterious errors.

But don't panic. In this lesson, you'll learn how you can troubleshoot errors so you can get your workflow up and running as soon as possible.

## Checking failed workflows

n8n tracks executions of your workflows.

When one of your workflows fails, you can check the Executions log to see what went wrong. The Executions log shows you a list of the latest execution time, status, mode, and running time of your saved workflows.

Open the Executions log by selecting [**Executions**](../../../workflows/executions/#execution-modes) in the left-side panel.

To investigate a specific failed execution from the list, select the name or the **View** button that appears when you hover over the row of the respective execution.

This will open the workflow in read-only mode, where you can see the execution of each node. This representation can help you identify at what point the workflow ran into issues.

To toggle between viewing the execution and the editor, select the **Editor | Executions** button at the top of the page.

*Workflow execution view*

## Catching erroring workflows

To catch failed workflows, create a separate [**Error Workflow**](../../../flow-logic/error-handling/) with the [**Error Trigger node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.errortrigger/). This workflow will only execute if the main workflow execution fails.

Use additional nodes in your **Error Workflow** that make sense, like sending notifications about the failed workflow and its errors using email or Slack.

To receive error messages for a failed workflow, set the **Error Workflow** in the [Workflow Settings](../../../workflows/settings/) to an Error Workflow that uses an **Error Trigger node**.

The only difference between a regular workflow and an Error Workflow is that the latter contains an **Error Trigger node**. Make sure to create this node before you set this as another workflow's designated Error Workflow.

- If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow.
- If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.
- You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.
- You can set the same Error Workflow for multiple workflows.

In the previous chapters, you've built several small workflows. Now, pick one of them that you want to monitor and create an Error Workflow for it:

1. Create a new Error Workflow.
1. Add the **Error Trigger node**.
1. Connect a node for the communication platform of your choice to the Error Trigger node, like [Slack](../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/), [Discord](../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/), [Telegram](../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/), or even [Gmail](../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) or a more generic [Send Email](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendemail/).
1. In the workflow you want to monitor, open the [Workflow Settings](../../../workflows/settings/) and select the new Error Workflow you just created. Note that this workflow needs to run automatically to trigger the error workflow.

The workflow for this exercise looks like this:

To check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:

## Throwing exceptions in workflows

Another way of troubleshooting workflows is to include a [**Stop and Error node**](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) in your workflow. This node throws an error. You can specify the error type:

- **Error Message**: returns a custom message about the error
- **Error Object**: returns the type of error

You can only use the **Stop and Error node** as the last node in a workflow.

Throwing exceptions with the **Stop and Error node** is useful for verifying the data (or assumptions about the data) from a node and returning custom error messages.

If you are working with data from a third-party service, you may come across problems such as:

- Wrongly formatted JSON output
- Data with the wrong type (for example, numeric data that has a non-numeric value)
- Missing values
- Errors from remote servers

Though this kind of invalid data might not cause the workflow to fail right away, it could cause problems later on, and then it can become difficult to track the source error. This is why it's better to throw an error at the time you know there might be a problem.

*Stop and Error node with error message*

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
{
	"nodes": [
		{
			"parameters": {},
			"name": "Error Trigger",
			"type": "n8n-nodes-base.errorTrigger",
			"typeVersion": 1,
			"position": [
				720,
				-380
			]
		},
		{
			"parameters": {
				"channel": "channelname",

				"otherOptions": {}
			},
			"name": "Slack",
			"type": "n8n-nodes-base.slack",

				900,
				-380
			],
			"typeVersion": 1,

				"slackApi": {
					"id": "17",

		}
	],

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
- Node options
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

Use the GitHub Document Loader node to load data from a GitHub repository for [vector stores](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store) or summarization.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the GitHub Document Loader node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/github/). This node doesn't support OAuth for authentication.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Text Splitting**: Choose from:
  - **Simple**: Uses the [Recursive Character Text Splitter](../n8n-nodes-langchain.textsplitterrecursivecharactertextsplitter/) with a chunk size of 1000 and an overlap of 200.
  - **Custom**: Allows you to connect a text splitter of your choice.
- **Repository Link**: Enter the URL of your GitHub repository.
- **Branch**: Enter the branch name to use.

- **Recursive**: Select whether to include sub-folders and files (turned on) or not (turned off).

## Sentiment Analysis node

**URL:** llms-txt#sentiment-analysis-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
- Node options
- Usage Notes
  - Model Temperature Setting
  - Language Considerations
  - Processing Large Volumes
  - Iterative Refinement
- Example Usage
  - Basic Sentiment Analysis
  - Custom Category Analysis

Use the Sentiment Analysis node to analyze the sentiment of incoming text data.

The language model uses the [**Sentiment Categories**](#node-options) in the node options to determine each item's sentiment.

- **Text to Analyze** defines the input text for sentiment analysis. This is an expression that references a field from the input items. For example, this could be `{{ $json.chatInput }}` if the input is from a chat or message source. By default, it expects a `text` field.

- **Sentiment Categories**: Define the categories that you want to classify your input as.
  - By default, these are `Positive, Neutral, Negative`. You can customize these categories to fit your specific use case, such as `Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Very Negative` for more granular analysis.
- **Include Detailed Results**: When turned on, this option includes sentiment strength and confidence scores in the output. Note that these scores are estimates generated by the language model and are rough indicators rather than precise measurements.
- **System Prompt Template**: Use this option to change the system prompt that's used for the sentiment analysis. It uses the `{categories}` placeholder for the categories.
- **Enable Auto-Fixing**: When enabled, the node automatically fixes model outputs to ensure they match the expected format. Do this by sending the schema parsing error to the LLM and asking it to fix it.

### Model Temperature Setting

It's strongly advised to set the temperature of the connected language model to 0 or a value close to 0. This helps ensure that the results are as deterministic as possible, providing more consistent and reliable sentiment analysis across multiple runs.

### Language Considerations

The node's performance may vary depending on the language of the input text.

For best results, ensure your chosen language model supports the input language.

### Processing Large Volumes

When analyzing large amounts of text, consider splitting the input into smaller chunks to optimize processing time and resource usage.

### Iterative Refinement

For complex sentiment analysis tasks, you may need to iteratively refine the system prompt and categories to achieve the desired results.

### Basic Sentiment Analysis

1. Connect a data source (for example, RSS Feed, HTTP Request) to the Sentiment Analysis node.
1. Set the "Text to Analyze" field to the relevant item property (for example, `{{ $json.content }}` for blog post content).
1. Keep the default sentiment categories.
1. Connect the node's outputs to separate paths for processing positive, neutral, and negative sentiments differently.

### Custom Category Analysis

1. Change the **Sentiment Categories** to `Excited, Happy, Neutral, Disappointed, Angry`.
1. Adjust your workflow to handle these five output categories.
1. Use this setup to analyze customer feedback with more nuanced emotional categories.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings Google PaLM node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/googleai/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Model**: Select the model to use to generate the embedding.

n8n dynamically loads models from the Google PaLM API and you'll only see the models available to your account.

## Telegram node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#telegram-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Add a bot to a Telegram channel
- Get the Chat ID
- Send more than 30 messages per second
- Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Telegram node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Add a bot to a Telegram channel

For a bot to send a message to a channel, you must add the bot to the channel. If you haven't added the bot to the channel, you'll see an error with a description like: `Error: Forbidden: bot is not a participant of the channel`.

To add a bot to a channel:

1. In the Telegram app, access the target channel and select the channel name.
1. Label the channel name as **public channel**.
1. Select **Administrators** > **Add Admin**.
1. Search for the bot's username and select it.
1. Select the checkmark on the top-right corner to add the bot to the channel.

You can only use `@channelusername` on public channels. To interact with a Telegram group, you need that group's Chat ID.

There are three ways to get that ID:

1. From the Telegram Trigger: Use the [Telegram Trigger](../../../trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/) node in your workflow to get a Chat ID. This node can trigger on different events and returns a Chat ID on successful execution.
1. From your web browser: Open Telegram in a web browser and open the group chat. The group's Chat ID is the series of digits behind the letter "g." Prefix your group Chat ID with a `-` when you enter it in n8n.
1. Invite Telegram's [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) to the group: Once you add it, the bot outputs a JSON file that includes a `chat` object. The `id` for that object is the group Chat ID. Then remove the RawDataBot from your group.

## Send more than 30 messages per second

The Telegram API has a [limitation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#broadcasting-to-users) of sending only 30 messages per second. Follow these steps to send more than 30 messages:

1. **Loop Over Items node**: Use the [Loop Over Items](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to get at most 30 chat IDs from your database.
1. **Telegram node**: Connect the Telegram node with the Loop Over Items node. Use the **Expression Editor** to select the Chat IDs from the Loop Over Items node.
1. **Code node**: Connect the [Code](../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node with the Telegram node. Use the Code node to wait for a few seconds before fetching the next batch of chat IDs. Connect this node with the Loop Over Items node.

You can also use this [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/772).

## Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages

If you're using the node to [send Telegram messages](../message-operations/#send-message), the message automatically gets an n8n attribution appended to the end:

> This message was sent automatically with n8n

To remove this attribution:

1. In the node's **Additional Fields** section, select **Add Field**.
1. Select **Append n8n attribution**.
1. Turn the toggle off.

Refer to [Send Message additional fields](../message-operations/#send-message-additional-fields) for more information.

## 3. Filtering Orders

**URL:** llms-txt#3.-filtering-orders

**Contents:**
- Add If node before the Airtable node
- Configure the If node
- Insert data into Airtable
- What's next?

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to filter data using conditional logic and how to use expressions in nodes using the [If node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/).

After this step, your workflow should look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.3.json)

To insert only processing orders into Airtable we need to filter our data by `orderStatus`. Basically, we want to tell the program that *if* the `orderStatus` is processing, *then* insert all records with this status into Airtable; *else*, for example, if the `orderStatus` isn't *processing*, calculate the sum of all orders with the other `orderStatus` (`booked`).

This if-then-else command is conditional logic. In n8n workflows, you can add conditional logic with the [If node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/), which splits a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations.

If you need to filter data on more than boolean values (true and false), use the [Switch node](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/). The Switch node is similar to the If node, but supports multiple output connectors.

## Add If node before the Airtable node

First, let's add an If node between the connection from the HTTP Request node to the Airtable node:

1. Hover over the arrow connection the **HTTP Request** node and the **Airtable** node.
1. Select the **+** sign between the HTTP Request node and the Airtable node.

## Configure the If node

Selecting the plus removes the connection to the Airtable node to the HTTP request. Now, let's add an If node connected to the HTTP Request node:

1. Search for the If node.
1. Select it when it appears in the search.

For the If node, we'll use an expression.

An [expression](../../../../glossary/#expression-n8n) is a string of characters and symbols in a programming language that can be evaluated to get a value, often according to its input. In n8n workflows, you can use expressions in a node to refer to another node for input data. In our example, the If node references the data output by the HTTP Request node.

In the If node window, configure the parameters:

- Set the `value1` placeholder to `{{ $json.orderStatus }}` with the following steps:

1. Hover over the value1 field.

1. Select the **Expression** tab on the right side of the `value1` field.

1. Next, open the expression editor by selecting the link icon:

*Opening the Expression Editor*

1. Use the left-side panel to select **HTTP Request** > **orderStatus** and drag it into the **Expression** field in the center of the window.

*Expression Editor in the If node*

1. Once you add the expression, close the **Edit Expression** dialog.

- **Operation**: Select **String** > **is equal to**

- Set the `value2` placeholder to `processing`.

Make sure to select the correct data type (boolean, date & time, number, or string) when you select the **Operation**.

Select **Execute step** to test the If node.

Your results should look like this:

Note that the orders with a `processing` order status should show for the **True Branch** output, while the orders with a `booked` order status should show in the **False Branch** output.

Close the If node detail view when you're finished.

## Insert data into Airtable

Next, we want to insert this data into Airtable. Remember what Nathan said at the end of the [Inserting data into Airtable](../chapter-5.2/) lesson?

> I actually need to insert only processing orders in the table...

Since Nathan only needs the `processing` orders in the table, we'll connect the Airtable node to the If node's `true` connector.

In this case, since the Airtable node is already on our canvas, select the **If node** `true` connector and drag it to the Airtable node.

It's a good idea at this point to retest the Airtable node. Before you do, open your table in Airtable and delete all existing rows. Then open the Airtable node window in n8n and select **Execute step**.

Review your data in Airtable to be sure your workflow only added the correct orders (those with `orderStatus` of `processing`). There should be 14 records now instead of 30.

At this stage, your workflow should look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.3.json)

**Nathan 🙋**: This If node is so useful for filtering data! Now I have all the information about processing orders. I actually only need the `employeeName` and `orderID`, but I guess I can keep all the other fields just in case.

**You 👩‍🔧**: Actually, I wouldn't recommend doing that. Inserting more data requires more computational power, the data transfer is slower and takes longer, and takes up more storage resources in your table. In this particular case, 14 records with 5 fields might not seem like it'd make a significant difference, but if your business grows to thousands of records and dozens of fields, things add up and even one extra column can affect performance.

**Nathan 🙋**: Oh, that's good to know. Can you select only two fields from the processing orders?

**You 👩‍🔧**: Sure, I'll do that in the next step.

## Think Tool node

**URL:** llms-txt#think-tool-node

**Contents:**
- Templates and examples
  - Prompting example
- Related resources

The Think Tool node is a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) that invites an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to do some thinking before answering. Essentially, it allows the agent to reflect on the question by talking to itself before providing an answer. In particular, this is useful for complex queries that require a thoughtful response.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

### Prompting example

As an example, say you ask the agent:

> *Jack is looking at Anne. Anne is looking at George. Jack is married, George is not, and we don't know if Anne is married. Is a married person looking at an unmarried person?*

The agent will do its thinking with the tool:

> *We have the following information: 1. Jack is looking at Anne. 2. Anne is looking at George. 3. Jack is married. 4. George is not married. 5. We don't know if Anne is married or not.*
>
> *We need to determine if a married person is looking at an unmarried person. Let's consider both cases for Anne:*
>
> *Case 1: Anne is married.*
>
> - *If Anne is married, then she (married) is looking at George (unmarried). In this case, a married person (Anne) is looking at an unmarried person (George).*
>
> *Case 2: Anne is unmarried.*
>
> - *If Anne is unmarried, then Jack (married) is looking at Anne (unmarried). In this case, a married person (Jack) is looking at an unmarried person (Anne).*
>
> *In both scenarios, we find that a married person is looking at an unmarried person. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes.*

and then afterward provide the answer:

> *Yes, a married person is looking at an unmarried person. In both possible scenarios regarding Anne's marital status, we find that a married individual (either Jack or Anne) is looking at an unmarried individual (either George or Anne).*

## MCP Server Trigger node

- Node parameters
  - MCP URL

  - Path
- Templates and examples

- Limitations
  - Configuring the MCP Server Trigger node with webhook replicas

Use the MCP Server Trigger node to allow n8n to act as a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server, making n8n tools and workflows available to MCP clients.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/httprequest/).

## How the MCP Server Trigger node works

The MCP Server Trigger node acts as an entry point into n8n for MCP clients. It operates by exposing a URL that MCP clients can interact with to access n8n tools.

Unlike conventional [trigger nodes](../../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n), which respond to events and pass their output to the next [connected node](../../../../workflows/components/connections/), the MCP Server Trigger node only connects to and executes [tool](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/) nodes. Clients can list the available tools and call individual tools to perform work.

You can expose n8n workflows to clients by attaching them with the [Custom n8n Workflow Tool](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) node.

Server-Sent Events (SSE) and streamable HTTP support

The MCP Server Trigger node supports both [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#server-sent-events-sse), a long-lived transport built on top of HTTP, and [streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) for connections between clients and the server. It currently doesn't support [standard input/output (stdio)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#standard-input%2Foutput-stdio) transport.

Use these parameters to configure your node.

The MCP Server Trigger node has two **MCP URLs**: test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel.

Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.

- **Test**: n8n registers a test MCP URL when you select **Listen for Test Event** or **Execute workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the MCP URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
- **Production**: n8n registers a production MCP URL when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.

You can require authentication for clients connecting to your MCP URL. Choose from these authentication methods:

- Bearer auth
- Header auth

Refer to the [HTTP request credentials](../../credentials/httprequest/) for more information on setting up each credential type.

By default, this field contains a randomly generated MCP URL path, to avoid conflicts with other MCP Server Trigger nodes.

You can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs.

### Integrating with Claude Desktop

You can connect to the MCP Server Trigger node from [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) by running a gateway to proxy SSE messages to stdio-based servers.

To do so, add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration:

Be sure to replace the `<MCP_URL>` and `<MCP_BEARER_TOKEN>` placeholders with the values from your MCP Server Trigger node parameters and credentials.

### Configuring the MCP Server Trigger node with webhook replicas

The MCP Server Trigger node relies on Server-Sent Events (SSE) or streamable HTTP, which require the same server instance to handle persistent connections. This can cause problems when running n8n in [queue mode](../../../../hosting/scaling/queue-mode/) depending on your [webhook processor](../../../../hosting/scaling/queue-mode/#webhook-processors) configuration:

- If you use queue mode with a **single webhook replica**, the MCP Server Trigger node works as expected.
- If you run **multiple webhook replicas**, you need to route all `/mcp*` requests to a single, dedicated webhook replica. Create a separate replica set with one webhook container for MCP requests. Afterward, update your ingress or load balancer configuration to direct all `/mcp*` traffic to that instance.

Caution when running with multiple webhook replicas

If you run an MCP Server Trigger node with multiple webhook replicas and don't route all `/mcp*` requests to a single, dedicated webhook replica, your SSE and streamable HTTP connections will frequently break or fail to reliably deliver events.

n8n also provides an [MCP Client Tool](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolmcp/) node that allows you to connect your n8n AI agents to external tools.

Refer to the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) and [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/) for more details about the protocol, servers, and clients.

Here are some common errors and issues with the MCP Server Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

### Running the MCP Server Trigger node with a reverse proxy

When running n8n behind a reverse proxy like nginx, you may experience problems if the MCP endpoint isn't configured for SSE or streamable HTTP.

Specifically, you need to disable proxy buffering for the endpoint. Other items you might want to adjust include disabling gzip compression (n8n handles this itself), disabling chunked transfer encoding, and setting the `Connection` to an empty string to remove it from the forwarded headers. Explicitly disabling these in the MCP endpoint ensures they're not inherited from other places in your nginx configuration.

An example nginx location block for serving MCP traffic with these settings may look like this:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "<MCP_URL>",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AUTH_TOKEN": "<MCP_BEARER_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
location /mcp/ {
    proxy_http_version          1.1;
    proxy_buffering             off;
    gzip                        off;
    chunked_transfer_encoding   off;

    proxy_set_header            Connection '';

    # The rest of your proxy headers and settings
    # . . .
}
```

Embed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.

The requirements provided here are an example based on n8n Cloud and are for illustrative purposes only. Your requirements may vary depending on the number of users, workflows, and executions. Contact n8n for more information.

| Component | Sizing                                   | Supported                   |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| CPU/vCPU  | Minimum 10 CPU cycles, scaling as needed | Any public or private cloud |
| Database  | 512 MB - 4 GB SSD                        | SQLite or PostgreSQL        |
| Memory    | 320 MB - 2 GB                            |                             |

## CPU considerations

n8n isn't CPU intensive so even small instances (of providers such as AWS and GCP) should be enough for most use cases. Usually, memory requirements supersede CPU requirements, so focus resources there when planning your infrastructure.

## Database considerations

n8n uses its database to store [credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n), past executions, and workflows.

A core feature of n8n is the flexibility to choose a database. All the supported databases have different advantages and disadvantages, which you have to consider individually and pick the one that best suits your needs. By default n8n creates an SQLite database if no database exists at the given location.

n8n recommends that every n8n instance have a dedicated database. This helps to prevent dependencies and potential performance degradation. If it isn't possible to provide a dedicated database for every n8n instance, n8n recommends making use of Postgres's schema feature.

For Postgres, the database must already exist on the DB-instance. The database user for the n8n process needs to have full permissions on all tables that they're using or creating. n8n creates and maintains the database schema.

- SSD storage.
- In containerized cloud environments, ensure that the volume is persisted and mounted when stopping/starting a container. If not, all data is lost.
- If using Postgres, don't use the `tablePrefix` configuration option. It will be deprecated in the near future.
- Pay attention to the changelog of new versions and consider reverting migrations before downgrading.
- Set up at least the basic database security and stability mechanisms such as IP allow lists and backups.

## Memory considerations

An n8n instance doesn't typically require large amounts of available memory. For example an n8n Cloud instance at idle requires ~100MB. It's the nature of your workflows and the data being processed that determines your memory requirements.

For example, while most nodes just pass data to the next node in the workflow, the [Code node](../../code/code-node/) creates a pre-processing and post-processing copy of the data. When dealing will large binary files, this can consume all available resources.

Configure the Tools Agent using the following parameters.

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

- **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
- **Define below**: If you select this option, provide either static text or an expression for dynamic content to serve as the prompt in the **Prompt (User Message)** field.

### Require Specific Output Format

This parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of these output parsers to the node:

- [Auto-fixing Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/)
- [Item List Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparseritemlist/)
- [Structured Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

Refine the Tools Agent node's behavior using these options:

If you'd like to send a message to the agent before the conversation starts, enter the message you'd like to send.

Use this option to guide the agent's decision-making.

Enter the number of times the model should run to try and generate a good answer from the user's prompt.

### Return Intermediate Steps

Select whether to include intermediate steps the agent took in the final output (turned on) or not (turned off).

This could be useful for further refining the agent's behavior based on the steps it took.

### Automatically Passthrough Binary Images

Use this option to control whether binary images should be automatically passed through to the agent as image type messages (turned on) or not (turned off).

When enabled, the AI Agent sends data back to the user in real-time as it generates the answer. This is useful for long-running generations. This is enabled by default.

Streaming requirements

For streaming to work, your workflow must use a trigger that supports streaming responses, such as the [Chat Trigger](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) or [Webhook](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node with **Response Mode** set to **Streaming**.

## Templates and examples

Refer to the main AI Agent node's [Templates and examples](../#templates-and-examples) section.

## Dynamic parameters for tools with `$fromAI()`

To learn how to dynamically populate parameters for app node tools, refer to [Let AI specify tool parameters with `$fromAI()`](../../../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).

## Building community nodes

**URL:** llms-txt#building-community-nodes

**Contents:**
- Standards
- Submit your node for verification by n8n

Community nodes are npm packages, hosted in the npm registry.

When building a node to submit to the community node repository, use the following resources to make sure your node setup is correct:

- n8n recommends using the [`n8n-node` CLI tool](../../creating-nodes/build/n8n-node/) to build and test your node. In particular, this is important if you plan on [submitting your node for verification](../../creating-nodes/deploy/submit-community-nodes/#submit-your-node-for-verification-by-n8n). This ensures that your node has the correct structure and follows community node requirements. It also simplifies linting and testing.
- View [n8n's own nodes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes) for examples of patterns you can use in your nodes.
- Refer to the documentation on [building your own nodes](../../creating-nodes/overview/).
- Make sure your node follows the [standards](#standards) for community nodes.

Developing with the [`n8n-node` tool](../../creating-nodes/build/n8n-node/) ensures that your node adheres to the following standards required to make your node available in the n8n community node repository:

- Make sure the package name starts with `n8n-nodes-` or `@<scope>/n8n-nodes-`. For example, `n8n-nodes-weather` or `@weatherPlugins/n8n-nodes-weather`.
- Include `n8n-community-node-package` in your package keywords.
- Make sure that you add your nodes and credentials to the `package.json` file inside the `n8n` attribute.
- Check your node using the linter (`npm run lint`) and test it locally (`npm run dev`) to ensure it works.
- Submit the package to the npm registry. Refer to npm's documentation on [Contributing packages to the registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry) for more information.

## Submit your node for verification by n8n

n8n vets verified community nodes. Users can discover and install verified community nodes from the nodes panel in n8n. These nodes need to adhere to certain technical and UX standards and constraints.

Before submitting your node for review by n8n, you must:

- Start from the [`n8n-node` tool](../../creating-nodes/build/n8n-node/) generated scaffolding. While this isn't strictly required, n8n strongly suggests using the `n8n-node` CLI tool for any community node you plan to submit for verification. Using the tool ensures that your node follows the expected conventions and adheres to the community node requirements.
- Make sure that your node follows the [technical guidelines for verified community nodes](../../creating-nodes/build/reference/verification-guidelines/) and that all automated checks pass. Specifically, verified community nodes aren't allowed to use any run-time dependencies.
- Ensure that your node follows the [UX guidelines](../../creating-nodes/build/reference/ux-guidelines/).
- Make sure that the node has appropriate documentation in the form of a README in the [npm package](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-package-readme-files) or a related public repository.
- Submit your node to npm as n8n will fetch it from there for final vetting.

If your node meets all the above requirements, sign up or log in to the [n8n Creator Portal](https://creators.n8n.io/nodes) and submit your node for verification. Note that n8n reserves the right to reject nodes that compete with any of n8n's paid features, especially enterprise functionality.

  - Limit Wait Time
- Related resources
- Common issues

Use the Respond to Chat node in correspondence with the [Chat Trigger](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) node to send a response into the chat and optionally wait for a response from the user. This allows you to have multiple chat interactions within a single execution and enables human-in-the-loop use cases in the chat.

The Respond to Chat node requires a [Chat Trigger](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) node to be present in the workflow, with the [Response Mode](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/#response-mode) set to 'Using Response Nodes'.

The message to send to the chat.

### Wait for User Reply

Set whether the workflow execution should wait for a response from the user (enabled) or continue immediately after sending the message (disabled).

### Add Memory Input Connection

Choose whether you want to commit the messages from the Respond to Chat node to a connected memory. Using a shared memory between an agent or chain [root node](../../cluster-nodes/root-nodes/) and the Respond to Chat node attaches the same session key to these messages and lets you capture the full message history.

When you enable **Wait for User Reply**, this option decides whether the workflow automatically resumes execution after a specific limit (enabled) or not (disabled).

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Structured Output Parser node, and links to more resources.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Schema Type**: Define the output structure and validation. You have two options to provide the schema:

1. **Generate from JSON Example**: Input an example JSON object to automatically generate the schema. The node uses the object property types and names. It ignores the actual values. n8n treats every field as mandatory when generating schemas from JSON examples.
1. **Define using JSON Schema**: Manually input the JSON schema. Read the JSON Schema [guides and examples](https://json-schema.org/learn/miscellaneous-examples) for help creating a valid JSON schema. Please note that we don't support references (using `$ref`) in JSON schemas.

## Node versioning

**URL:** llms-txt#node-versioning

**Contents:**
- Light versioning
- Full versioning

n8n supports node versioning. You can make changes to existing nodes without breaking the existing behavior by introducing a new version.

Be aware of how n8n decides which node version to load:

- If a user builds and saves a workflow using version 1, n8n continues to use version 1 in that workflow, even if you create and publish a version 2 of the node.
- When a user creates a new workflow and browses for nodes, n8n always loads the latest version of the node.

Versioning type restricted by node style

If you build a node using the declarative style, you can't use full versioning.

This is available for all node types.

One node can contain more than one version, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature:

1. Change the main `version` parameter to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version.
1. You can then access the version parameter with `@version` in your `displayOptions` in any object (to control which versions n8n displays the object with). You can also query the version from a function using `const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;`.

As an example, say you want to add versioning to the NasaPics node from the [Declarative node tutorial](../../declarative-style-node/), then configure a resource so that n8n only displays it in version 2 of the node. In your base `NasaPics.node.ts` file:

This isn't available for declarative-style nodes.

As an example, refer to the [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost).

Full versioning summary:

- The base node file should extend `NodeVersionedType` instead of `INodeType`.
- The base node file should contain a description including the `defaultVersion` (usually the latest), other basic node metadata such as name, and a list of versions. It shouldn't contain any node functionality.
- n8n recommends using `v1`, `v2`, and so on, for version folder names.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
{
    displayName: 'NASA Pics',
    name: 'NasaPics',
    icon: 'file:nasapics.svg',
    // List the available versions
    version: [1,2,3],
    // More basic parameters here
    properties: [
        // Add a resource that's only displayed for version2
        {
            displayName: 'Resource name',
            // More resource parameters
            displayOptions: {
                show: {
                    '@version': 2,
                },
            },
        },
    ],
}
```

## Date & Time

**URL:** llms-txt#date-&-time

**Contents:**
- Operations
- Add to a Date
  - Add to a Date options
- Extract Part of a Date
  - Extract Part of a Date options
- Format a Date
  - Format a Date options
- Get Current Date
  - Get Current Date options
- Get Time Between Dates

The Date & Time node manipulates date and time data and convert it to different formats.

The node relies on the timezone setting. n8n uses either:

1. The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to [Workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/) for more information.
1. The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is `America/New York` for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using [Environment variables](../../../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/). Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the [Admin dashboard](../../../../manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/).

Date and time in other nodes

You can work with data and time in the Code node, and in expressions in any node. n8n supports Luxon to help work with date and time in JavaScript. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](../../../../code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information.

- **Add to a Date**: Add a specified amount of time to a date.

## Your first workflow

**URL:** llms-txt#your-first-workflow

**Contents:**
- Step one: Create a new workflow
- Step two: Add a trigger node
- Step three: Add the NASA node and set up credentials
- Step four: Add logic with the If node
- Step five: Output data from your workflow
- Step six: Test the workflow
- Congratulations
- Next steps

This guide will show you how to construct a [workflow](../../glossary/#workflow-n8n) in n8n, explaining key concepts along the way. You will:

- Create a workflow from scratch.
- Understand key concepts and skills, including:
  - Starting workflows with trigger nodes
  - Configuring [credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n)
  - Processing data
  - Representing logic in an n8n workflow
  - Using [expressions](../../glossary/#expression-n8n)

This quickstart uses [n8n Cloud](../../manage-cloud/overview/), which is recommended for new users. A free trial is available - if you haven't already done so, [sign up](https://app.n8n.cloud/register) for an account now.

## Step one: Create a new workflow

When you open n8n, you'll see either:

- A window with a welcome message and two large buttons: Choose **Start from Scratch** to create a new workflow.
- The **Workflows** list on the **Overview** page. Select the **Create Workflow** to create a new workflow.

## Step two: Add a trigger node

n8n provides two ways to start a workflow:

- Manually, by selecting **Execute Workflow**.
- Automatically, using a trigger node as the first node. The trigger node runs the workflow in response to an external event, or based on your settings.

For this tutorial, we'll use the [Schedule trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/). This allows you to run the workflow on a schedule:

1. Select **Add first step**.
1. Search for **Schedule**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.
1. Select **Schedule Trigger** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.
1. For **Trigger Interval**, select **Weeks**.
1. For **Weeks Between Triggers**, enter `1`.
1. Enter a time and day. For this example, select **Monday** in **Trigger on Weekdays**, select **9am** in **Trigger at Hour**, and enter `0` in **Trigger at Minute**.
1. Close the node details view to return to the canvas.

## Step three: Add the NASA node and set up credentials

The [NASA node](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.nasa/) interacts with NASA's [public APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/) to fetch useful data. We will use the real-time data from the API to find solar events.

Credentials are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node. The type of information required varies depending on the app/service concerned. You should be careful about sharing or revealing the credentials outside of n8n.

1. Select the **Add node** connector on the Schedule Trigger node.

1. Search for **NASA**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.

1. Select **NASA** to view a list of operations.

1. Search for and select **Get a DONKI solar flare**. This operation returns a report about recent solar flares. When you select the operation, n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.

1. To access the NASA APIs, you need to set up credentials:

1. Select the **Credential for NASA API** dropdown.
   1. Select **Create new credential**. n8n opens the credentials view.
   1. Go to [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/) and fill out the form from the **Generate API Key** link. The NASA site generates the key and emails it to the address you entered.
   1. Check your email account for the API key. Copy the key, and paste it into **API Key** in n8n.
   1. Select **Save**.
   1. Close the credentials screen. n8n returns to the node. The new credentials should be automatically selected in **Credential for NASA API**.

1. By default, DONKI Solar Flare provides data for the past 30 days. To limit it to just the last week, use **Additional Fields**:

1. Select **Add field**.

1. Select **Start date**.

1. To get a report starting from a week ago, you can use an expression: next to **Start date**, select the **Expression** tab, then select the expand button to open the full expressions editor.

1. In the **Expression** field, enter the following expression:

This generates a date in the correct format, seven days before the current date. Date and time formats in n8n...

n8n uses Luxon to work with date and time, and also provides two variables for convenience: `$now` and `$today`. For more information, refer to [Expressions > Luxon](../../code/cookbook/luxon/).

1. Close the **Edit Expression** modal to return to the NASA node.

1. You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select **Execute step** to run the node manually. n8n calls the NASA API and displays details of solar flares in the past seven days in the **OUTPUT** section.

1. Close the NASA node to return to the workflow canvas.

## Step four: Add logic with the If node

n8n supports complex logic in workflows. In this tutorial we will use the [If node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) to create two branches that each generate a report from the NASA data. Solar flares have five possible classifications; we will add logic that sends a report with the lower classifications to one output, and the higher classifications to another.

1. Select the **Add node** connector on the NASA node.

1. Search for **If**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.

1. Select **If** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.

1. You need to check the value of the `classType` property in the NASA data. To do this:

1. Drag **classType** into **Value 1**.

Make sure you ran the NASA node in the previous section

If you didn't follow the step in the previous section to run the NASA node, you won't see any data to work with in this step.

1. Change the comparison operation to **String > Contains**.

1. In **Value 2**, enter **X**. This is the highest classification of solar flare. In the next step, you will create two reports: one for X class solar flares, and one for all the smaller solar flares.

1. You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select **Execute step** to run the node manually. n8n tests the data against the condition, and shows which results match true or false in the **OUTPUT** panel.

Weeks without large solar flares

In this tutorial, you are working with live data. If you find there aren't any X class solar flares when you run the workflow, try replacing **X** in **Value 2** with either **A**, **B**, **C**, or **M**.

1. Once you are happy the node will return some events, you can close the node to return to the canvas.

## Step five: Output data from your workflow

The last step of the workflow is to send the two reports about solar flares. For this example, you'll send data to [Postbin](https://www.toptal.com/developers/postbin/). Postbin is a service that receives data and displays it on a temporary web page.

1. On the If node, select the **Add node** connector labeled **true**.

1. Search for **PostBin**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.

1. Select **PostBin**.

1. Select **Send a request**. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.

1. Go to [Postbin](https://www.toptal.com/developers/postbin/) and select **Create Bin**. Leave the tab open so you can come back to it when testing the workflow.

1. Copy the bin ID. It looks similar to `1651063625300-2016451240051`.

1. In n8n, paste your Postbin ID into **Bin ID**.

1. Now, configure the data to send to Postbin. Next to **Bin Content**, select the **Expression** tab (you will need to mouse-over the **Bin Content** for the tab to appear), then select the expand button to open the full expressions editor.

1. You can now click and drag the correct field from the If Node output into the expressions editor to automatically create a reference for this label. In this case the input we want is 'classType'.

1. Once dropped into the expressions editor it will transform into this reference: `{{$json["classType"]}}`. Add a message to it, so that the full expression is:

1. Close the expressions editor to return to the node.

1. Close the Postbin node to return to the canvas.

1. Add another Postbin node, to handle the **false** output path from the If node:

1. Hover over the Postbin node, then select **Node context menu** > **Duplicate node** to duplicate the first Postbin node.
   1. Drag the **false** connector from the If node to the left side of the new Postbin node.

## Step six: Test the workflow

1. You can now test the entire workflow. Select **Execute Workflow**. n8n runs the workflow, showing each stage in progress.
1. Go back to your Postbin bin. Refresh the page to see the output.
1. If you want to use this workflow (in other words, if you want it to run once a week automatically), you need to activate it by selecting the **Active** toggle.

Postbin's bins exist for 30 minutes after creation. You may need to create a new bin and update the ID in the Postbin nodes, if you exceed this time limit.

You now have a fully functioning workflow that does something useful! It should look something like this:

- How to find the nodes you want and join them together
- How to use expressions to manipulate data
- How to create credentials and attach them to nodes
- How to use logic in your workflows

## UX guidelines for community nodes

**URL:** llms-txt#ux-guidelines-for-community-nodes

**Contents:**
- Credentials
  - OAuth
- Node structure
  - Operations to include
  - Resource Locator
  - Consistency with other nodes
  - Sorting options
- Node functionality
  - Deleting operations output
  - Simplifying output fields

Your node's UI must conform to these guidelines to be a [verified community node](../../../deploy/submit-community-nodes/#submit-your-node-for-verification-by-n8n) candidate.

API key and sensitive credentials should always be password fields.

Always include the OAuth credential if available.

### Operations to include

Try to include **CRUD** operations for each resource type.

Try to include common operations in nodes for each resource. n8n uses some CRUD operations to keep the experience consistent and allow users to perform basic operations on the resource. The suggested operations are:

- **Create**
- **Create or Update (Upsert)**
- **Delete**
- **Get**
- **Get Many:** also used when some filtering or search is available
- **Update**

1. These operations can apply to the resource itself or an entity inside of the resource (for example, a row inside a Google Sheet). When operating on an entity inside of the resource, you must specify the **name of the entity** in the operations name.
1. The naming could change depending on the node and the resource. Check the following guidelines for details.

- Use a Resource Locator component whenever possible. This provides a much better UX for users. The Resource Locator Component is most often useful when you have to select a single item.
- The default option for the Resource Locator Component should be `From list` (if available).

### Consistency with other nodes

- Maintain UX consistency: n8n tries to keep its UX consistent. This means following existing UX patterns, in particular, those used in the latest new or overhauled nodes.
- Check similar nodes: For example, if you're working on a database node, it's worth checking the Postgres node.

- You can enhance certain "Get Many" operations by providing users with sorting options.
- Add sorting in a dedicated collection (below the "Options" collection). Follow the example of [Airtable Record:Search](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/92e2a8e61a4189025e5d4bac8be81576b624fe85/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable/v2/actions/record/search.operation.ts#L85-L135).

## Node functionality

### Deleting operations output

When deleting an item (like a record or a row), return an array with a single object: `{"deleted": true}`. This is a confirmation for the user that the deletion was successful and the item will trigger the following node.

### Simplifying output fields

#### Normal nodes: 'Simplify' parameter

When an endpoint returns data with more than 10 fields, add the "Simplify" boolean parameter to return a simplified version of the output with max 10 fields.

- One of the main issues with n8n can be the size of data and the Simplify parameter limits that problem by reducing data size.
- Select the most useful fields to output in the simplified node and sort them to have the most used ones at the top.
- In the Simplify mode, it's often best to flatten nested fields
- Display Name: `Simplify`
- Description: `Whether to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data`

#### AI tool nodes: ‘Output’ parameter

When an endpoint returns data with more than 10 fields, add the 'Output' option parameter with 3 modes.

In AI tool nodes, allow the user to be more granular and select the fields to output. The rationale is that tools may run out of context window and they can get confused by too many fields, so it's better to pass only the ones they need.

- **Simplified:** Works the same as the "Simplify" parameter described above.
- **Raw:** Returns all the available fields.
- **Selected fields:** Shows a multi-option parameter for selecting the fields to add to the output and send to the AI agent. By default, this option always returns the ID of the record/entity.

Use **Title Case** for the node `name`, `parameters display names` (labels), `dropdown titles`. Title Case is when you capitalize the first letter of each word, except for certain small words, such as articles and short prepositions.

Use **Sentence case** for node `action` names, node `descriptions`, `parameters descriptions` (tooltips), `hints`, `dropdown descriptions`.

- **Use the third-party service terminology:** Try to use the same terminology as the service you're interfacing with (for example, Notion 'blocks', not Notion 'paragraphs').
- **Use the terminology used in the UI:** Stick to the terminology used in the user interface of the service, rather than that used in the APIs or technical documentation (for example, in Trello you "archive" cards, but in the API they show up as "closed". In this case, you might want to use "archive").
- **No tech jargon:** Don't use technical jargon where simple words will do. For example, use "field" instead of "key".
- **Consistent naming:** Choose one term for something and stick to it. For example, don't mix "directory" and "folder".

It's often helpful to insert examples of content in parameters placeholders. These should start with "e.g." and use **camel case** for the demo content in fields.

Placeholder examples to copy:

- image: `e.g. https://example.com/image.png`
- video: `e.g. https://example.com/video.mp4`
- search term: `e.g. automation`
- email: `e.g. nathan@example.com`
- Twitter user (or similar): `e.g. n8n`
- Name and last name: `e.g. Nathan Smith`
- First name: `e.g. Nathan`
- Last name: `e.g. Smith`

### Operations name, action, and description

- **Name:** This is the name displayed in the select when the node is open on the canvas. It must use title case and doesn't have to include the resource (for example, "Delete").
- **Action:** This is the name of the operation displayed in the panel where the user selects the node. It must be in sentence case and must include the resource (for example, "Delete record").
- **Description:** This is the sub-text displayed below the name in the select when the node is open on the canvas. It must use sentence case and must include the resource. It can add a bit of information and use alternative words than the basic resource/operation (for example, "Retrieve a list of users").
- If the operation acts on an entity that's not the Resource (for example, a row in a Google Sheet), specify that in the operation name (for example, "Delete Row").

As a general rule, is important to understand what the **object** of an operation is. Sometimes, the object of an Operation is the resource itself (for example, `Sheet:Delete` to delete a Sheet).

In other cases, the object of the operation isn't the resource, but something contained inside the resource (for example, `Table:Delete rows`, here the resource is the table, but what you are operating on are the rows inside of it).

This is the name displayed in the select when the node is open on the canvas.

- Parameter: `name`
- Case: Title Case

- **Don't repeat the resource (if the resource selection is above):** The resource is often displayed above the operation, so it's not necessary to repeat it in the operation (this is the case if the object of the operation is the resource itself).
  - For example: `Sheet:Delete` → No need to repeat `Sheet` in `Delete`, because n8n displays `Sheet` in the field above and what you're deleting is the Sheet.
- **Specify the resource if there's no resource selection above:** In some nodes, you won't have a resource selection (because there's only one resource). In these cases, specify the resource in the operation.
  - For example: `Delete Records` → In Airtable, there's no resource selection, so it's better to specify that the Delete operation will delete records.
- **Specify the object of the operation if it's not the resource:** Sometimes, the object of the operation isn't the resource. In these cases, specify the object in the operation as well.
  - For example: `Table:Get Columns` → Specify `Columns` because the resource is `Table`, while the object of the operation is `Columns`.

This is the name of the operation displayed in the panel where the user selects the node. * Parameter: `action` * Case: Sentence case

- **Omit articles:** To keep the text shorter, get rid of articles (a, an, the…).
  - **correct**: `Update row in sheet`
  - **incorrect**: `Update a row in a sheet`
- **Repeat the resource:** In this case, it's okay to repeat the resource. Even if the resource is visible in the list, the user might not notice and it's useful to repeat it in the operation label.
- **Specify the object of the operation if it is not the resource:** Same as for the operation name. In this case, you don't need to repeat the resource.
  - For example: `Append Rows` → You have to specify `Rows` because rows are what you're actually appending to. Don't add the resource (`Sheet`) since you aren't appending to the resource.

#### Naming `description`

This is the subtext displayed below the name in the selection when the node is open on the canvas.

- Parameter: `description`
- Case: Sentence case

- If possible, add more information than that specified in the operation `name`
- Use alternative wording to help users better understand what the operation is doing. Some people might not understand the text used in the operation (maybe English isn't their native language), and using alternative working could help them.

n8n uses a general vocabulary and some context-specific vocabulary for groups of similar applications (for example, databases or spreadsheets).

The general vocabulary takes inspiration from CRUD operations:

- **Clear**
  - Delete all the contents of the resource (empty the resource).
  - Description: `Delete all the <CHILD_ELEMENT>s inside the <RESOURCE>`
- **Create**
  - Create a new instance of the resource.
  - Description: `Create a new <RESOURCE>`
- **Create or Update**
  - Create or update an existing instance of the resource.
  - Description: `Create a new <RESOURCE> or update an existing one (upsert)`
- **Delete**
  - You can use "Delete" in two different ways:
    1. Delete a resource:
       - Description: `Delete a <RESOURCE> permanently` (use "permanently" only if that's the case)
    1. Delete something **inside** of the resource (for example, a row):
       - In this case, **always specify the object of the operation**: for example, `Delete Rows` or `Delete Records`.
       - Description: `Delete a <CHILD_ELEMENT> permanently`
- **Get**
  - You can use "Get" in two different ways:
    1. Get a resource:
       - Description: `Retrieve a <RESOURCE>`
    1. Get an item **inside** of the resource (for example, records):
       - In this case, **always specify the object of the operation**: for example, `Get Row` or `Get Record`.
       - Description: `Retrieve a <CHILD_ELEMENT> from the/a <RESOURCE>`
- **Get Many**
  - You can use "Get Many" in two different ways:
    1. Get a list of resources (without filtering):
       - Description: `Retrieve a list of <RESOURCE>s`
    1. Get a list of items **inside** of the resource (for example, records):
       - In this case, **always specify the object of the operation**: for example, `Get Many Rows` or `Get Many Records`.
       - You can omit `Many`: `Get Many Rows` can be `Get Rows`.
       - Description: `List all <CHILD_ELEMENT>s in the/a <RESOURCE>`
- **Insert** or **Append**
  - Add something inside of a resource.
  - Use `insert` for database nodes.
  - Description: `Insert <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) in a <RESOURCE>`
- **Insert or Update** or **Append or Update**
  - Add or update something inside of a resource.
  - Use `insert` for database nodes.
  - Description: `Insert <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) or update an existing one(s) (upsert)`
- **Update**
  - You can use "Update" in two different ways:
    1. Update a resource:
       - Description: `Update one or more <RESOURCE>s`
    1. Update something **inside** of a resource (for example, a row):
       - In this case, **always specify the object of the operation**: for example, `Update Rows` or `Update Records`.
       - Description: `Update <CHILD_ELEMENT>(s) inside a <RESOURCE>`

### Referring to parameter and field name

When you need to refer to parameter names or field names in copy, wrap them in single quotation marks (for example, "Please fill the `'name'` parameter).

### Boolean description

Start the description of boolean components with 'Whether...'

### General philosophy

Errors are sources of pain for users. For this reason, n8n always wants to tell the user:

- **What happened**: a description of the error and what went wrong.
- **How to solve the problem**: or at least how to get unstuck and continue using n8n without problems. n8n doesn't want users to remain blocked, so use this as an opportunity to guide them to success.

### Error structure in the Output panel

#### Error Message - What happened

This message explains to the user what happened, and the current issue that prevents the execution completing.

- If you have the `displayName` of the parameter that triggered the error, include it in the error message or description (or both).
- Item index: if you have the ID of the item that triggered the error, append `[Item X]` to the error message. For example, `The ID of the release in the parameter “Release ID” for could not be found [item 2]`.
- Avoid using words like "error", "problem", "failure", "mistake".

#### Error Description - How to solve or get unstuck

The description explains to users how to solve the problem, what to change in the node configuration (if that's the case), or how to get unstuck. Here, you should guide them to the next step and unblock them.

Avoid using words like "error", "problem", "failure", "mistake".

## Execution order in multi-branch workflows

**URL:** llms-txt#execution-order-in-multi-branch-workflows

n8n's node execution order depends on the version of n8n you're using:

- For workflows created before version 1.0: n8n executes the first node of each branch, then the second node of each branch, and so on.
- For workflows created in version 1.0 and above: executes each branch in turn, completing one branch before starting another. n8n orders the branches based on their position on the [canvas](../../glossary/#canvas-n8n), from topmost to bottommost. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost branch executes first.

You can change the execution order in your [workflow settings](../../workflows/settings/).

## Metric-based evaluations

**URL:** llms-txt#metric-based-evaluations

**Contents:**
  - What are metric-based evaluations?
- How it works
  - 1. Set up light evaluation
  - 2. Add metrics to workflow
  - 3. Run evaluation and view results

Available on Pro and Enterprise plans

Metric-based evaluation is available on Pro and Enterprise plans. Registered community and Starter plan users can also use it for a single workflow.

### What are metric-based evaluations?

Once your workflow is ready for deployment, you often want to test it on more examples than [when you were building it](../light-evaluations/).

For example, when production executions start to turn up edge cases, you want to add them to your test dataset so that you can make sure they're covered.

For large datasets like the ones built from production data, it can be hard to get a sense of performance just by eyeballing the results. Instead, you must measure performance. Metric-based evaluations can assign one or more scores to each test run, which you can compare to previous runs. Individual scores get rolled up to measure performance on the whole dataset.

This feature allows you to run evaluations that calculate metrics, track how those metrics change between runs and drill down into the reasons for those changes.

Metrics can be deterministic functions (such as the distance between two strings) or you can calculate them using AI. Metrics often involve checking how far away the output is from a *reference output* (also called ground truth). To do so, the dataset must contain that reference output. Some evaluations don't need this reference output though (for example, checking text for sentiment or toxicity).

Credentials for Google Sheets

Evaluations use data tables or Google Sheets to store the test dataset. To use Google Sheets as a dataset source, configure a [Google Sheets credential](../../../integrations/builtin/credentials/google/).

1. Set up [light evaluation](../light-evaluations/)
1. Add metrics to workflow
1. Run evaluation and view results

### 1. Set up light evaluation

Follow the [setup instructions](../light-evaluations/) to create a dataset and wire it up to your workflow, writing outputs back to the dataset.

The following steps use the same support ticket classification workflow from the light evaluation docs:

### 2. Add metrics to workflow

Metrics are dimensions used to score the output of your workflow. They often compare the actual workflow output with a reference output. It's common to use AI to calculate metrics, although it's sometimes possible to just use code. In n8n, metrics are always numbers.

You need to add the logic to calculate the metrics for your workflow, at a point after it has produced the outputs. You can add any reference outputs your metric uses as a column in your dataset. This makes sure they it will be available in the workflow, since they will be output by the evaluation trigger.

Use the **Set Metrics** operation to calculate:

- **Correctness (AI-based)**: Whether the answer's meaning is consistent with a supplied reference answer. Uses a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the best.
- **Helpfulness (AI-based)**: Whether the response answers the given query. Uses a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the best.
- **String Similarity**: How close the answer is to the reference answer, measured character-by-character (edit distance). Returns a score between 0 and 1.
- **Categorization**: Whether the answer is an exact match with the reference answer. Returns 1 when matching and 0 otherwise.
- **Tools Used**: Whether the execution used tools or not. Returns a score between 0 and 1.

You can also add custom metrics. Just calculate the metrics within the workflow and then map them into an Evaluation node. Use the **Set Metrics** operation and choose **Custom Metrics** as the Metric. You can then set the names and values for the metrics you want to return.

- [RAG document relevance](https://n8n.io/workflows/4273): when working with a vector database, whether the documents retrieved are relevant to the question.

Calculating metrics can add latency and cost, so you may only want to do it when running an evaluation and avoid it when making a production execution. You can do this by putting the metric logic after a ['check if evaluating' operation](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.evaluation/#check-if-evaluating).

### 3. Run evaluation and view results

Switch to the **Evaluations** tab on your workflow and click the **Run evaluation** button. An evaluation will start. Once the evaluation has finished, it will display a summary score for each metric.

You can see the results for each test case by clicking on the test run row. Clicking on an individual test case will open the execution that produced it (in a new tab).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Limit**: Enter the maximum number of results to return.

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Code integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/code/) page.

Function and Function Item nodes

The Code node replaces the Function and Function Item nodes from version 0.198.0. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can still view the [Function node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function.md) and [Function Item node documentation](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/67935ad2528e2e30d7984ea917e4af2910a096ec/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.functionItem.md).

How to use the Code node.

- **Run Once for All Items**: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.
- **Run Once for Each Item**: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.

The Code node supports Node.js.

### Supported JavaScript features

The Code node supports:

- Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.
- Writing to your browser console using `console.log`. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.

### External libraries

If you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the [Enable modules in Code node](../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) guide.

If you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:

- [crypto Node.js module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/crypto.html)
- [moment npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)

### Built-in methods and variables

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `$variableName` or `$methodName()`. Type `$` in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. See the full list of [keyboard shortcuts](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/keyboard-shortcuts/).

## Python (Pyodide - legacy)

Pyodide is a legacy feature. Future versions of n8n will no longer support this feature.

n8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the [Packages included with Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide). n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.

Slower than JavaScript

The Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.

### Built-in methods and variables

n8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../builtin/overview/) for more information.

The syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `_variableName` or `_methodName()`. Type `_` in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.

### Keyboard shortcuts

The Code node editing environment supports time-saving and useful keyboard shortcuts for a range of operations from autocompletion to code-folding and using multiple-cursors. See the full list of [keyboard shortcuts](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/keyboard-shortcuts/).

## File system and HTTP requests

You can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:

- [Read/Write File From Disk](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)
- [HTTP Request](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)

## Python (Native - beta)

n8n added native Python support using task runners (beta) in version 1.111.0.

Main differences from Pyodide:

- Native Python supports only `_items` in all-items mode and `_item` in per-item mode. It doesn't support other n8n built-in methods and variables.
- Native Python supports importing native Python modules from the standard library and from third-parties, if the `n8nio/runners` image includes them and explicitly allowlists them. See [adding extra dependencies for task runners](../../hosting/configuration/task-runners/#adding-extra-dependencies) for more details.
- Native Python denies insecure built-ins by default. See [task runners environment variables](../../hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/) for more details.
- Unlike Pyodide, which accepts dot access notation, for example, `item.json.myNewField`, native Python only accepts bracket access notation, for example, `item["json"]["my_new_field"]`. There may be other minor syntax differences where Pyodide accepts constructs that aren't legal in native Python.

Keep in mind upgrading to native Python is a breaking change, so you may need to adjust your Python scripts to use the native Python runner.

This feature is in beta and is subject to change. As it becomes stable, n8n will roll it out progressively to n8n cloud users during 2025. Self-hosting users can [try it out](../../hosting/configuration/task-runners/) and provide feedback.

There are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.

When working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:

- [Data structure](../../data/data-structure/): understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.
- [Item linking](../../data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/): learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.

### Built-in methods and variables

n8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:

- Accessing specific item data
- Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment
- Convenience variables to help with data and time

Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](../builtin/overview/) for more information.

## Use AI in the Code node

AI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.

AI generated code overwrites your code

If you've already written some code on the **Code** tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.

To use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:

1. In the Code node, set **Language** to **JavaScript**.
1. Select the **Ask AI** tab.
1. Write your query.
1. Select **Generate Code**. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the **Code** tab.

## What's memory in AI?

**URL:** llms-txt#what's-memory-in-ai?

**Contents:**
- AI memory in n8n

Memory is a key part of AI chat services. The [memory](../../../glossary/#ai-memory) keeps a history of previous messages, allowing for an ongoing conversation with the AI, rather than every interaction starting fresh.

To add memory to your AI workflow you can use either:

- [Simple Memory](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/): stores a customizable length of chat history for the current session. This is the easiest to get started with.
- One of the memory services that n8n provides nodes for. These include:
  - [Motorhead](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymotorhead/)
  - [Redis Chat Memory](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryredischat/)
  - [Postgres Chat Memory](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorypostgreschat/)
  - [Xata](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryxata/)
  - [Zep](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryzep/)

If you need to do advanced AI memory management in your workflows, use the [Chat Memory Manager](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorymanager/) node.

This node is useful when you:

- Can't add a memory node directly.
- Need to do more complex memory management, beyond what the memory nodes offer. For example, you can add this node to check the memory size of the Agent node's response, and reduce it if needed.
- Want to inject messages to the AI that look like user messages, to give the AI more context.

## Supabase Vector Store node

**URL:** llms-txt#supabase-vector-store-node

**Contents:**
- Node usage patterns
  - Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents
  - Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool
  - Use a retriever to fetch documents
  - Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions
- Node parameters
  - Operation Mode
  - Rerank Results
  - Get Many parameters
  - Insert Documents parameters

Use the Supabase Vector Store to interact with your Supabase database as vector store. You can insert documents into a vector database, get many documents from a vector database, and retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a chain.

Use the Supabase Vector Store to interact with your Supabase database as [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store). You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a [chain](../../../../../glossary/#ai-chain), or connect it directly to an [agent](../../../../../glossary/#ai-agent) to use as a [tool](../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool). You can also update an item in a vector store by its ID.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Supabase node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/supabase/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

Supabase provides a [quickstart for setting up your vector store](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/langchain?database-method=sql). If you use settings other than the defaults in the quickstart, this may affect parameter settings in n8n. Make sure you understand what you're doing.

## Node usage patterns

You can use the Supabase Vector Store node in the following patterns.

### Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents

You can use the Supabase Vector Store as a regular node to insert, update, or get documents. This pattern places the Supabase Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.

You can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/).

### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool

You can connect the Supabase Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](../n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use a vector store as a resource when answering queries.

Here, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Supabase Vector Store node.

### Use a retriever to fetch documents

You can use the [Vector Store Retriever](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Supabase Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Supabase Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](../n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.

An [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the example uses Pinecone, but the pattern in the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Supabase Vector Store.

### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions

Another pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Supabase Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Supabase Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.

The [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Supabase Vector store.

This Vector Store node has five modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**, and **Update Documents**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.

In this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.

#### Insert Documents

Use Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.

#### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)

Use Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.

#### Update Documents

Use Update Documents mode to update documents in a vector database by ID. Fill in the **ID** with the ID of the embedding entry to update.

Enables [reranking](../../../../../glossary/#ai-reranking). If you enable this option, you must connect a reranking node to the vector store. That node will then rerank the results for queries. You can use this option with the `Get Many`, `Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)` and `Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)` modes.

### Get Many parameters

- **Table Name**: Enter the Supabase table to use.
- **Prompt**: Enter the search query.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

### Insert Documents parameters

- **Table Name**: Enter the Supabase table to use.

### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters

- **Table Name**: Enter the Supabase table to use.

### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters

- **Name**: The name of the vector store.
- **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.
- **Table Name**: Enter the Supabase table to use.
- **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.

- **Table Name**: Enter the Supabase table to use.
- **ID**: The ID of an embedding entry.

Parameters for **Update Documents**

The name of the matching function you set up in Supabase. If you follow the [Supabase quickstart](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/langchain?database-method=sql), this will be `match_documents`.

Available in **Get Many** mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document.

This is an `AND` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.

When inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.

## Output to the browser console with `console.log()` or `print()` in the Code node

**URL:** llms-txt#output-to-the-browser-console-with-`console.log()`-or-`print()`-in-the-code-node

**Contents:**
- console.log (JavaScript)
- print (Python)
  - Handling an output of `[object Object]`

You can use `console.log()` or `print()` in the Code node to help when writing and debugging your code.

For help opening your browser console, refer to [this guide by Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/support/faqs/browserconsole/).

## console.log (JavaScript)

For technical information on `console.log()`, refer to the [MDN developer docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log).

For example, copy the following code into a Code node, then open your console and run the node:

For technical information on `print()`, refer to the [Real Python's guide](https://realpython.com/python-print/).

For example, set your Code node **Language** to **Python**, copy the following code into the node, then open your console and run the node:

### Handling an output of `[object Object]`

If the console displays `[object Object]` when you print, check the data type, then convert it as needed.

To check the data type:

If `type()` outputs `<class 'pyodide.ffi.JsProxy'>`, you need to convert the JsProxy to a native Python object using `to_py()`. This occurs when working with data in the n8n node data structure, such as node inputs and outputs. For example, if you want to print the data from a previous node in the workflow:

Refer to the Pyodide documentation on [JsProxy](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/api/python-api/ffi.html#pyodide.ffi.JsProxy) for more information on this class.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
let a = "apple";
console.log(a);
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
a = "apple"
print(a)
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
print(type(myData))
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
previousNodeData = _("<node-name>").all();
for item in previousNodeData:
	# item is of type <class 'pyodide.ffi.JsProxy'>
	# You need to convert it to a Dict
	itemDict = item.json.to_py()
	print(itemDict)
```

## Build a programmatic-style node

**URL:** llms-txt#build-a-programmatic-style-node

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Build your node
  - Step 1: Set up the project
  - Step 2: Add an icon
  - Step 3: Define the node in the base file
  - Step 4: Add the execute method
  - Step 5: Set up authentication
  - Step 6: Add node metadata
  - Step 7: Update the npm package details
- Test your node

This tutorial walks through building a programmatic-style node. Before you begin, make sure this is the node style you need. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](../../plan/choose-node-method/) for more information.

You need the following installed on your development machine:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).

You need some understanding of:

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- REST APIs
- git
- [Expressions](../../../../glossary/#expression-n8n) in n8n

In this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/). You'll create a node that implements one piece of SendGrid functionality: create a contact.

n8n has a built-in SendGrid node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name.

### Step 1: Set up the project

n8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter.

Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

1. [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate) from the template repository.

1. Clone your new repository:

The starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:

- `nodes/ExampleNode`
- `nodes/HTTPBin`
- `credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts`
- `credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`

Now create the following directories and files:

`nodes/FriendGrid`\
`nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.json`\
`nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.ts`\
`credentials/FriendGridApi.credentials.ts`

These are the key files required for any node. Refer to [Node file structure](../reference/node-file-structure/) for more information on required files and recommended organization.

Now install the project dependencies:

### Step 2: Add an icon

Save the SendGrid SVG logo from [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/SendGrid/sendGrid.svg) as `friendGrid.svg` in `nodes/FriendGrid/`.

n8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio.

Don't reference Font Awesome

If you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image.

### Step 3: Define the node in the base file

Every node must have a base file. Refer to [Node base file](../reference/node-base-files/) for detailed information about base file parameters.

In this example, the file is `FriendGrid.node.ts`. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to [Node file structure](../reference/node-file-structure/) for more information.

#### Step 3.1: Imports

Start by adding the import statements:

#### Step 3.2: Create the main class

The node must export an interface that implements `INodeType`. This interface must include a `description` interface, which in turn contains the `properties` array.

Class names and file names

Make sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class `FriendGrid`, the filename must be `FriendGrid.node.ts`.

#### Step 3.3: Add node details

All programmatic nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name and icon. Add the following to the `description`:

n8n uses some of the properties set in `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `icon`, and `description`.

#### Step 3.4: Add the resource

The resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access one of SendGrid's API endpoints: `/v3/marketing/contacts`. This means you need to define a resource for this endpoint. Update the `properties` array with the resource object:

`type` controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](../reference/ui-elements/) for more information.

#### Step 3.5: Add operations

The operations object defines what you can do with a resource. It usually relates to REST API verbs (GET, POST, and so on). In this tutorial, there's one operation: create a contact. It has one required field, the email address for the contact the user creates.

Add the following to the `properties` array, after the `resource` object:

#### Step 3.6: Add optional fields

Most APIs, including the SendGrid API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.

To avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under **Additional Fields** in the UI.

For this tutorial, you'll add two additional fields, to allow users to enter the contact's first name and last name. Add the following to the properties array:

### Step 4: Add the execute method

You've set up the node UI and basic information. It's time to map the node UI to API requests, and make the node actually do something.

The `execute` method runs every time the node runs. In this method, you have access to the input items and to the parameters that the user set in the UI, including the credentials.

Add the following the `execute` method in the `FriendGrid.node.ts`:

Note the following lines of this code:

Users can provide data in two ways:

- Entered directly in the node fields
- By mapping data from earlier nodes in the workflow

`getInputData()`, and the subsequent loop, allows the node to handle situations where data comes from a previous node. This includes supporting multiple inputs. This means that if, for example, the previous node outputs contact information for five people, your FriendGrid node can create five contacts.

### Step 5: Set up authentication

The SendGrid API requires users to authenticate with an API key.

Add the following to `FriendGridApi.credentials.ts`

For more information about credentials files and options, refer to [Credentials file](../reference/credentials-files/).

### Step 6: Add node metadata

Metadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is `FriendGrid.node.json`.

Add the following code to the JSON file:

For more information on these parameters, refer to [Node codex files](../reference/node-codex-files/).

### Step 7: Update the npm package details

Your npm package details are in the `package.json` at the root of the project. It's essential to include the `n8n` object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information:

You need to update the `package.json` to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm `package.json` files, refer to [npm's package.json documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json).

You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.

1. Install n8n using npm:

1. When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:

1. Install the node into your local n8n instance:

Make sure you run `npm link <node-name>` in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be:

- `~/.n8n/custom/`
   - `~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>`: if your n8n installation set a different name using `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`.

1. Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.

Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is `n8n-nodes-weather-nodes`, and the package contains nodes named `rain`, `sun`, `snow`, you should search for `rain`, not `weather-nodes`.

If there's no `custom` directory in `~/.n8n` local installation, you have to create `custom` directory manually and run `npm init`:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-friendgrid
   cd n8n-nodes-friendgrid
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
npm i
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown

	INodeType,
	INodeTypeDescription,
    NodeConnectionType
} from 'n8n-workflow';

import {
	OptionsWithUri,
} from 'request';
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
export class FriendGrid implements INodeType {
	description: INodeTypeDescription = {
		// Basic node details will go here
		properties: [
			// Resources and operations will go here
		],
	};
	// The execute method will go here
	async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {

The Contextual Compression Retriever node improves the answers returned from [vector store](../../../../../glossary/#ai-vector-store) document similarity searches by taking into account the context from the query.

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

## Build a declarative-style node

**URL:** llms-txt#build-a-declarative-style-node

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Build your node
  - Step 1: Set up the project
  - Step 2: Add an icon
  - Step 3: Create the node
  - Step 4: Set up authentication
  - Step 5: Add node metadata
  - Step 6: Update the npm package details
- Test your node
  - Troubleshooting

This tutorial walks through building a declarative-style node. Before you begin, make sure this is the node style you need. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](../../plan/choose-node-method/) for more information.

You need the following installed on your development machine:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).

You need some understanding of:

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- REST APIs
- git

In this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/). You'll create a node that uses two of NASA's services: APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) and Mars Rover Photos. To keep the code examples short, the node won't implement every available option for the Mars Rover Photos endpoint.

n8n has a built-in NASA node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name.

### Step 1: Set up the project

n8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter.

Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

1. [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate) from the template repository.

1. Clone your new repository:

The starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:

- `nodes/ExampleNode`
- `nodes/HTTPBin`
- `credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts`
- `credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`

Now create the following directories and files:

`nodes/NasaPics`\
`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.json`\
`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.ts`\
`credentials/NasaPicsApi.credentials.ts`

These are the key files required for any node. Refer to [Node file structure](../reference/node-file-structure/) for more information on required files and recommended organization.

Now install the project dependencies:

### Step 2: Add an icon

Save the NASA SVG logo from [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/NASA_logo.svg) as `nasapics.svg` in `nodes/NasaPics/`.

n8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio.

Don't reference Font Awesome

If you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image.

### Step 3: Create the node

Every node must have a base file. Refer to [Node base file](../reference/node-base-files/) for detailed information about base file parameters.

In this example, the file is `NasaPics.node.ts`. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to [Node file structure](../reference/node-file-structure/) for more information.

#### Step 3.1: Imports

Start by adding the import statements:

#### Step 3.2: Create the main class

The node must export an interface that implements INodeType. This interface must include a `description` interface, which in turn contains the `properties` array.

Class names and file names

Make sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class `NasaPics`, the filename must be `NasaPics.node.ts`.

#### Step 3.3: Add node details

All nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name, icon, and the basic information for making a request using the node. Add the following to the `description`:

n8n uses some of the properties set in `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `icon`, `description`, and `subtitle`.

#### Step 3.4: Add resources

The resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access two of NASA's API endpoints: `planetary/apod` and `mars-photos`. This means you need to define two resource options in `NasaPics.node.ts`. Update the `properties` array with the resource object:

`type` controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](../reference/ui-elements/) for more information.

#### Step 3.5: Add operations

The operations object defines the available operations on a resource.

In a declarative-style node, the operations object includes `routing` (within the `options` array). This sets up the details of the API call.

Add the following to the `properties` array, after the `resource` object:

This code creates two operations: one to get today's APOD image, and another to send a get request for photos from one of the Mars Rovers. The object named `roverName` requires the user to choose which Rover they want photos from. The `routing` object in the Mars Rover operation references this to create the URL for the API call.

#### Step 3.6: Optional fields

Most APIs, including the NASA API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.

To avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under **Additional Fields** in the UI.

For this tutorial, you'll add one additional field, to allow users to pick a date to use with the APOD endpoint. Add the following to the properties array:

### Step 4: Set up authentication

The NASA API requires users to authenticate with an API key.

Add the following to `nasaPicsApi.credentials.ts`:

For more information about credentials files and options, refer to [Credentials file](../reference/credentials-files/).

### Step 5: Add node metadata

Metadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is `NasaPics.node.json`.

Add the following code to the JSON file:

For more information on these parameters, refer to [Node codex files](../reference/node-codex-files/).

### Step 6: Update the npm package details

Your npm package details are in the `package.json` at the root of the project. It's essential to include the `n8n` object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information:

You need to update the `package.json` to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm `package.json` files, refer to [npm's package.json documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json).

You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.

1. Install n8n using npm:

1. When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:

1. Install the node into your local n8n instance:

Make sure you run `npm link <node-name>` in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be:

- `~/.n8n/custom/`
   - `~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>`: if your n8n installation set a different name using `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`.

1. Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.

Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is `n8n-nodes-weather-nodes`, and the package contains nodes named `rain`, `sun`, `snow`, you should search for `rain`, not `weather-nodes`.

If there's no `custom` directory in `~/.n8n` local installation, you have to create `custom` directory manually and run `npm init`:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-nasa-pics

## Conversational AI Agent node

**URL:** llms-txt#conversational-ai-agent-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Prompt
  - Require Specific Output Format
- Node options
  - Human Message
  - System Message
  - Max Iterations
  - Return Intermediate Steps
- Templates and examples
- Common issues

n8n removed this functionality in February 2025.

The Conversational Agent has human-like conversations. It can maintain context, understand user intent, and provide relevant answers. This agent is typically used for building chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer support systems.

The Conversational Agent describes [tools](../../../../../../glossary/#ai-tool) in the system prompt and parses JSON responses for tool calls. If your preferred AI model doesn't support tool calling or you're handling simpler interactions, this agent is a good general option. It's more flexible but may be less accurate than the [Tools Agent](../tools-agent/).

Refer to [AI Agent](../) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

You can use this agent with the [Chat Trigger](../../../../core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) node. Attach a memory sub-node so that users can have an ongoing conversation with multiple queries. Memory doesn't persist between sessions.

Configure the Conversational Agent using the following parameters.

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

- **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
- **Define below**: If you select this option, provide either static text or an expression for dynamic content to serve as the prompt in the **Prompt (User Message)** field.

### Require Specific Output Format

This parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of these output parsers to the node:

- [Auto-fixing Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/)
- [Item List Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparseritemlist/)
- [Structured Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

Refine the Conversational Agent node's behavior using these options:

Tell the agent about the tools it can use and add context to the user's input.

You must include these expressions and variable:

- `{tools}`: A LangChain expression that provides a string of the tools you've connected to the Agent. Provide some context or explanation about who should use the tools and how they should use them.
- `{format_instructions}`: A LangChain expression that provides the schema or format from the output parser node you've connected. Since the instructions themselves are context, you don't need to provide context for this expression.
- `{{input}}`: A LangChain variable containing the user's prompt. This variable populates with the value of the **Prompt** parameter. Provide some context that this is the user's input.

Here's an example of how you might use these strings:

If you'd like to send a message to the agent before the conversation starts, enter the message you'd like to send.

Use this option to guide the agent's decision-making.

Enter the number of times the model should run to try and generate a good answer from the user's prompt.

### Return Intermediate Steps

Select whether to include intermediate steps the agent took in the final output (turned on) or not (turned off).

This could be useful for further refining the agent's behavior based on the steps it took.

## Templates and examples

Refer to the main AI Agent node's [Templates and examples](../#templates-and-examples) section.

For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](../common-issues/).

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
TOOLS
------
Assistant can ask the user to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the user's original question. The tools the human can use are:

{tools}

{format_instructions}

USER'S INPUT
--------------------
Here is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a JSON blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):

{{input}}

## ReAct AI Agent node

**URL:** llms-txt#react-ai-agent-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
  - Prompt
  - Require Specific Output Format
- Node options
  - Human Message Template
  - Prefix Message
  - Suffix Message for Chat Model
  - Suffix Message for Regular Model
  - Return Intermediate Steps
- Related resources

n8n removed this functionality in February 2025.

The ReAct Agent node implements [ReAct](https://react-lm.github.io/) logic. ReAct (reasoning and acting) brings together the reasoning powers of chain-of-thought prompting and action plan generation.

The ReAct Agent reasons about a given task, determines the necessary actions, and then executes them. It follows the cycle of reasoning and acting until it completes the task. The ReAct agent can break down complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks, prioritise them, and execute them one after the other.

Refer to [AI Agent](../) for more information on the AI Agent node itself.

The ReAct agent doesn't support memory sub-nodes. This means it can't recall previous prompts or simulate an ongoing conversation.

Configure the ReAct Agent using the following parameters.

Select how you want the node to construct the prompt (also known as the user's query or input from the chat).

- **Take from previous node automatically**: If you select this option, the node expects an input from a previous node called `chatInput`.
- **Define below**: If you select this option, provide either static text or an expression for dynamic content to serve as the prompt in the **Prompt (User Message)** field.

### Require Specific Output Format

This parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of these output parsers to the node:

- [Auto-fixing Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserautofixing/)
- [Item List Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparseritemlist/)
- [Structured Output Parser](../../../sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/)

Use the options to create a message to send to the agent at the start of the conversation. The message type depends on the model you're using:

- **Chat models**: These models have the concept of three components interacting (AI, system, and human). They can receive system messages and human messages (prompts).
- **Instruct models**: These models don't have the concept of separate AI, system, and human components. They receive one body of text, the instruct message.

### Human Message Template

Use this option to extend the user prompt. This is a way for the agent to pass information from one iteration to the next.

Available LangChain expressions:

- `{input}`: Contains the user prompt.
- `{agent_scratchpad}`: Information to remember for the next iteration.

Enter text to prefix the tools list at the start of the conversation. You don't need to add the list of tools. LangChain automatically adds the tools list.

### Suffix Message for Chat Model

Add text to append after the tools list at the start of the conversation when the agent uses a chat model. You don't need to add the list of tools. LangChain automatically adds the tools list.

### Suffix Message for Regular Model

Add text to append after the tools list at the start of the conversation when the agent uses a regular/instruct model. You don't need to add the list of tools. LangChain automatically adds the tools list.

### Return Intermediate Steps

Select whether to include intermediate steps the agent took in the final output (turned on) or not (turned off).

This could be useful for further refining the agent's behavior based on the steps it took.

Refer to LangChain's [ReAct Agents](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/agents/) documentation for more information.

## Embeddings Google Gemini node

**URL:** llms-txt#embeddings-google-gemini-node

**Contents:**
- Node parameters
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

Use the Embeddings Google Gemini node to generate [embeddings](../../../../../glossary/#ai-embedding) for a given text.

On this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Embeddings Google Gemini node, and links to more resources.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/googleai/).

Parameter resolution in sub-nodes

Sub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.

Most nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.

In sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.

- **Model**: Select the model to use to generate the embedding.

## Code node common issues

**URL:** llms-txt#code-node-common-issues

**Contents:**
- Code doesn't return items properly
- A 'json' property isn't an object
- Code doesn't return an object
- 'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level
- Cannot find module '<module>'
- Using global variables

Here are some common errors and issues with the [Code node](../) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.

## Code doesn't return items properly

This error occurs when the code in your Code node doesn't return data in the expected format.

In n8n, all data passed between nodes is an array of objects. Each of these objects wraps another object with the `json` key:

To troubleshoot this error, check the following:

- Read the [data structure](../../../../../data/data-structure/) to understand the data you receive in the Code node and the requirements for outputting data from the node.
- Understand how data items work and how to connect data items from previous nodes with [item linking](../../../../../data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/).

## A 'json' property isn't an object

This error occurs when the Code node returns data where the `json` key isn't pointing to an object.

This may happen if you set `json` to a different data structure, like an array:

To resolve this, ensure that the `json` key references an object in your return data:

## Code doesn't return an object

This error may occur when your Code node doesn't return anything or if it returns an unexpected result.

To resolve this, ensure that your Code node returns the [expected data structure](../../../../../data/data-structure/):

This error may also occur if the code you provided returns `'undefined'` instead of the expected result. In that case, ensure that the data you are referencing in your Code node exists in each execution and that it has the structure your code expects.

## 'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level

This error occurs if you try to use `import` or `export` in the Code node. These aren't supported by n8n's JavaScript sandbox. Instead, use the `require` function to load modules.

To resolve this issue, try changing your `import` statements to use `require`:

## Cannot find module '<module>'

This error occurs if you try to use `require` in the Code node and n8n can't find the module.

n8n doesn't support importing modules in the [Cloud](../../../../../manage-cloud/overview/) version.

If you're [self-hosting](../../../../../hosting/) n8n, follow these steps:

- Install the module into your n8n environment.
  - If you are running n8n with [npm](../../../../../hosting/installation/npm/), install the module in the same environment as n8n.
  - If you are running n8n with [Docker](../../../../../hosting/installation/docker/), you need to extend the official n8n image with a [custom image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/) that includes your module.
- Set the `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN` and `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL` [environment variables](../../../../../hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) to allow importing modules.

## Using global variables

Sometimes you may wish to set and retrieve simple global data related to a workflow across and within executions. For example, you may wish to include the date of the previous report when compiling a report with a list of project updates.

To set, update, and retrieve data directly to a workflow, use the [static data](../../../../../code/cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data/) functions within your code. You can manage data either globally or tied to specific nodes.

Use Remove Duplicates when possible

If you're interested in using variables to avoid processing the same data items more than once, consider using the [Remove Duplicates node](../../n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/) instead. The Remove Duplicates node can save information across executions to avoid processing the same items multiple times.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
[
  {
    "json": {
	  // your data goes here
	}
  }
]
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
[
  {
    "json": [
	  // Setting `json` to an array like this will produce an error
	]
  }
]
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
[
  {
    "json": {
	  // Setting `json` to an object as expected
	}
  }
]
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
[
  {
    "json": {
	  // your data goes here
	}
  }
]
```

## Node types: Trigger and Action

**URL:** llms-txt#node-types:-trigger-and-action

**Contents:**
- Trigger nodes
- Action nodes

There are two node types you can build for n8n: trigger nodes and action nodes.

Both types provide integrations with external services.

[Trigger nodes](../../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n) start a workflow and supply the initial data. A workflow can contain multiple trigger nodes but with each execution, only one of them will execute, depending on the triggering event.

There are three types of trigger nodes in n8n:

| Type    | Description                                                                                                                                 | Example Nodes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Find the folder ID

To perform operations on folders, you need to supply the ID. You can find this:

- In the URL of the folder
- By searching for it using the node. You need to do this if using MS 365 (where OneDrive uses SharePoint behind the scenes):
  1. Select **Resource** > **Folder**.
  1. Select **Operation** > **Search**.
  1. In **Query**, enter the folder name.
  1. Select **Execute step**. n8n runs the query and returns data about the folder, including an `id` field containing the folder ID.

## 2. Inserting data into Airtable

**URL:** llms-txt#2.-inserting-data-into-airtable

**Contents:**
- Configure your table
- Add an Airtable node to the HTTP Request node
- Test the Airtable node
- What's next?

In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to insert the data received from the HTTP Request node into Airtable using the [Airtable node](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/).

You can replace the Airtable node with another spreadsheet app/service. For example, n8n also has a node for [**Google Sheets**](../../../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/).

After this step, your workflow should look like this:

[View workflow file](/_workflows//courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.2.json)

## Configure your table

If we're going to insert data into Airtable, we first need to set up a table there. To do this:

1. [Create an Airtable account](https://airtable.com/signup).

1. In your Airtable workspace add a new base from scratch and name it, for example, *beginner course*.

*Create an Airtable base*

1. In the beginner course base, by default, you have a table called **Table 1** with four fields: `Name`, `Notes`, `Assignee`, and `Status`. These fields aren't relevant for us since they aren't in our "orders" data set. This brings us to the next point: the names of the fields in Airtable have to match the names of the columns in the node result. Prepare the table by doing the following:

- Rename the table from **Table 1** to **orders** to make it easier to identify.
   - Delete the 3 blank records created by default.
   - Delete the `Notes`, `Assignee`, and `Status` fields.
   - Edit the `Name` field (the primary field) to read `orderID`, with the **Number** field type.
   - Add the rest of the fields, and their field types, using the table below as a reference:

| Field name     | Field type       |
   | -------------- | ---------------- |
   | `orderID`      | Number           |
   | `customerID`   | Number           |
   | `employeeName` | Single line text |
   | `orderPrice`   | Number           |
   | `orderStatus`  | Single line text |

Now your table should look like this:

*Orders table in Airtable*

Now that the table is ready, let's return to the workflow in the n8n Editor UI.

## Add an Airtable node to the HTTP Request node

Add an Airtable node connected to the HTTP Request node.

You can add a node connected to an existing node by selecting the **+** icon next to the existing node.

1. Search for Airtable.
1. Select **Create a record** from the **Record Actions** search results.

This will add the Airtable node to your canvas and open the node details window.

In the Airtable node window, configure the following parameters:

- **Credential to connect with**:
  - Select **Create new credential**.
  - Keep the default option **Connect using: Access Token** selected.
  - **Access token**: Follow the instructions from the [Airtable credential](../../../../integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/) page to create your token. Use the recommended scopes and add access to your beginners course base. Save the credential and close the Credential window when you're finished.
- **Resource**: Record.
- **Operation**: Create. This operation will create new records in the table.
- **Base**: You can pick your base from a list (for example, beginner course).
- **Table**: orders.
- **Mapping Column Mode**: Map automatically. In this mode, the incoming data fields must have the same as the columns in Airtable.

## Test the Airtable node

Once you've finished configuring the Airtable node, execute it by selecting **Execute step**. This might take a moment to process, but you can follow the progress by viewing the base in Airtable.

Your results should look like this:

*Airtable node results*

All 30 data records will now appear in the orders table in Airtable:

*Imported records in the orders table*

**Nathan 🙋**: Wow, this automation is already so useful! But this inserts all collected data from the HTTP Request node into Airtable. Remember that I actually need to insert only processing orders in the table and calculate the price of booked orders?

**You 👩‍🔧**: Sure, no problem. As a next step, I'll use a new node to filter the orders based on their status.

## Looping in n8n

**URL:** llms-txt#looping-in-n8n

**Contents:**
- Using loops in n8n
  - Executing nodes once
- Creating loops
  - Loop until a condition is met
  - Loop until all items are processed
- Node exceptions

Looping is useful when you want to process multiple items or perform an action repeatedly, such as sending a message to every contact in your address book. n8n handles this repetitive processing automatically, meaning you don't need to specifically build loops into your workflows. There are [some nodes](#node-exceptions) where this isn't true.

## Using loops in n8n

n8n nodes take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can think of each item as a single data point, or a single row in the output table of a node.

Nodes usually run once for each item. For example, if you wanted to send the name and notes of the customers in the Customer Datastore node as a message on Slack, you would:

1. Connect the Slack node to the Customer Datastore node.
1. Configure the parameters.
1. Execute the node.

You would receive five messages: one for each item.

This is how you can process multiple items without having to explicitly connect nodes in a loop.

### Executing nodes once

For situations where you don't want a node to process all received items, for example sending a Slack message only to the first customer, you can do so by toggling the **Execute Once** parameter in the **Settings** tab of that node This setting is helpful when the incoming data contains multiple items and you want to only process the first one.

n8n typically handles the iteration for all incoming items. However, there are certain scenarios where you will have to create a loop to iterate through all items. Refer to [Node exceptions](#node-exceptions) for a list of nodes that don't automatically iterate over all incoming items.

### Loop until a condition is met

To create a loop in an n8n workflow, connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node. Add an [IF](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) node to check when to stop the loop.

Here is an [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1130) that implements a loop with an `IF` node:

### Loop until all items are processed

Use the [Loop Over Items](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node when you want to loop until all items are processed. To process each item individually, set **Batch Size** to `1`.

You can batch the data in groups and process these batches. This approach is useful for avoiding API rate limits when processing large incoming data or when you want to process a specific group of returned items.

The Loop Over Items node stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow so it's not necessary to add an IF node to stop the loop.

Nodes and operations where you need to design a loop into your workflow:

- [CrateDB](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.cratedb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.
- [Code](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node in **Run Once for All Items** mode: processes all the items based on the entered code snippet.
- [Execute Workflow](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node in **Run Once for All Items** mode.
- [HTTP Request](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/): you must handle pagination yourself. If your API call returns paginated results you must create a loop to fetch one page at a time.
- [Microsoft SQL](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftsql/) executes once for `insert`, `update`, and `delete`.
- [MongoDB](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mongodb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.
- [QuestDB](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.questdb/) executes once for `insert`.
- [Redis](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.redis/):
  - Info: this operation executes only once, regardless of the number of items in the incoming data.
- [RSS Read](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.rssfeedread/) executes once for the requested URL.
- [TimescaleDB](../../integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.timescaledb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.

## Data tables

**URL:** llms-txt#data-tables

**Contents:**
- Overview
- How to use data tables
  - Step 1: Creating a data table
  - Step 2: Interacting with Data tables in workflows
- Considerations and limitations of data tables
- Data tables versus variables
- Exporting and importing data

Data tables integrate data storage within your n8n environment. Using data tables, you can save, manage, and interact with data directly inside your workflows without relying on external database systems for scenarios such as:

- Persisting data across workflows in the same project
- Storing markers to prevent duplicate runs or control workflow triggers
- Reusing prompts or messages across workflows
- Storing evaluation data for AI workflows
- Storing data generated from workflow executions
- Combining data from different sources to enrich your datasets
- Creating lookup tables as quick reference points within workflows

## How to use data tables

There are two parts to working with data tables: creating them and interacting with them in workflows.

### Step 1: Creating a data table

1. In your n8n project, select the **Data tables** tab.
1. Click the split button located in the top right corner and select **Create Data table**.
1. Enter a descriptive name for your table.

In the table view that appears, you can:

- Add and reorder columns to organize your data
- Add, delete, and update rows
- Edit existing data

### Step 2: Interacting with Data tables in workflows

Interact with data tables in your workflow using the **Data table** node, which allows you to retreive, update, and manipulate the data stored in a Data table.

See [Data table node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datatable/).

## Considerations and limitations of data tables

- Data tables are suitable for light to moderate data storage. By default, a data table can't contain more than 50MB of data. In self-hosted environments, you can increase this default size limit using the environment variable `N8N_DATA_TABLES_MAX_SIZE_BYTES`.
- When a data table approaches 80% of your storage limit, a warning will alert you. A final warning appears when you reach the storage limit. Exceeding this limit will disable manual additions to tables and cause workflow execution errors during attempts to insert or update data.
- By default, data tables created within a project are accessible to all team members in that project.
- Tables created in a **Personal** space are only accessible by their creator.

## Data tables versus variables

| Feature                    | Data tables | Variables |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Unified tabular view       | ✓           | ✗         |
| Row-column relationships   | ✓           | ✗         |
| Cross-project access       | ✗           | ✓         |
| Individual value display   | ✗           | ✓         |
| Optimized for short values | ✗           | ✓         |
| Structured data            | ✓           | ✗         |
| Scoped to projects         | ✓           | ✗         |
| Use values as expressions  | ✗           | ✓         |

## Exporting and importing data

To transfer data between n8n and external tools, use workflows that:

1. Retrieve data from a data table.
1. Export it using an API or file export.
1. Import data into another system or data table accordingly.

## Exporting and importing workflows

**URL:** llms-txt#exporting-and-importing-workflows

**Contents:**
- Exporting and importing workflows

In this chapter, you will learn how to export and import workflows.

## Exporting and importing workflows

You can save n8n workflows locally as JSON files. This is useful if you want to share your workflow with someone else or import a workflow from someone else.

Exported workflow JSON files include [credential](../../../glossary/#credential-n8n) names and IDs. While IDs aren't sensitive, the names could be, depending on how you name your credentials. HTTP Request nodes may contain authentication headers when imported from cURL. Remove or anonymize this information from the JSON file before sharing to protect your credentials.

*Import & Export workflows menu*

You can export and import workflows in three ways:

- From the **Editor UI** menu:
  - Export: From the top navigation bar, select the three dots in the upper right, then select **Download**. This will download your current workflow as a JSON file on your computer.
  - Import: From the top navigation bar, select the three dots in the upper right, then select **Import from URL** (to import a published workflow) or **Import from File** (to import a workflow as a JSON file).
- From the **Editor UI** canvas:
  - Export: Select all the nodes on the canvas and use `Ctrl`+`C` to copy the workflow JSON. You can paste this into a file or share it directly with other people.
  - Import: You can paste a copied workflow JSON directly into the canvas with `Ctrl`+`V`.
- From the command line:
  - Export: See the [full list of commands](../../../hosting/cli-commands/) for exporting workflows or credentials.
  - Import: See the [full list of commands](../../../hosting/cli-commands/#import-workflows-and-credentials) for importing workflows or credentials.

## Error Trigger node

**URL:** llms-txt#error-trigger-node

**Contents:**
- Usage
- Templates and examples
- Related resources
- Error data

You can use the Error Trigger node to create error workflows. When another linked workflow fails, this node gets details about the failed workflow and the errors, and runs the error workflow.

1. Create a new workflow, with the Error Trigger as the first node.
1. Give the workflow a name, for example `Error Handler`.
1. Select **Save**.
1. In the workflow where you want to use this error workflow:
   1. Select **Options** > **Settings**.
   1. In **Error workflow**, select the workflow you just created. For example, if you used the name Error Handler, select **Error handler**.
   1. Select **Save**. Now, when this workflow errors, the related error workflow runs.

- If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow.
- If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.
- You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error Trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.

## Templates and examples

[Browse Error Trigger integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/error-trigger/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)

You can use the [Stop And Error](../n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) node to send custom messages to the Error Trigger.

Read more about [Error workflows](../../../../flow-logic/error-handling/) in n8n workflows.

The default error data received by the Error Trigger is:

All information is always present, except:

- `execution.id`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
- `execution.url`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.
- `execution.retryOf`: only present when the execution is a retry of a failed execution.

If the error is caused by the trigger node of the main workflow, rather than a later stage, the data sent to the error workflow is different. There's less information in `execution{}` and more in `trigger{}`:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
[
	{
		"execution": {
			"id": "231",
			"url": "https://n8n.example.com/execution/231",
			"retryOf": "34",
			"error": {
				"message": "Example Error Message",
				"stack": "Stacktrace"

			"lastNodeExecuted": "Node With Error",
			"mode": "manual"
		},
		"workflow": {

			"name": "Example Workflow"
		}
	}
]
```

Example 2 (unknown):

    "error": {
      "context": {},
      "name": "WorkflowActivationError",
      "cause": {

## Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node

**URL:** llms-txt#execute-sub-workflow-trigger-node

**Contents:**
- Usage
  - Create the sub-workflow
  - Call the sub-workflow
- Templates and examples
- How data passes between workflows

Use this node to start a workflow in response to another workflow. It should be the first node in the workflow.

n8n allows you to call workflows from other workflows. This is useful if you want to:

- Reuse a workflow: for example, you could have multiple workflows pulling and processing data from different sources, then have all those workflows call a single workflow that generates a report.
- Break large workflows into smaller components.

This node runs in response to a call from the [Execute Sub-workflow](../n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) or [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) nodes.

### Create the sub-workflow

1. Create a new workflow.

Create sub-workflows from existing workflows

You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the [Execute Sub-workflow](../n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node. In the node, select the **Database** and **From list** options and select **Create a sub-workflow** in the list.

You can also extract selected nodes directly using [Sub-workflow conversion](../../../../workflows/subworkflow-conversion/) in the context menu.

1. **Optional**: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:

1. Select the **Options** menu > **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.
   1. Change the **This workflow can be called by** setting. Refer to [Workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/) for more information on configuring your workflows.

1. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** trigger node (if you are searching under trigger nodes, this is also titled **When Executed by Another Workflow**).

1. Set the **Input data mode** to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:

- **Define using fields below**: Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide. The [Execute Sub-workflow node](../n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) or [Call n8n Workflow Tool node](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) in the calling workflow will automatically pull in the fields defined here.
   - **Define using JSON example**: Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.
   - **Accept all data**: Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.

1. Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.

1. Save the sub-workflow.

Sub-workflow mustn't contain errors

If there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.

Load data into sub-workflow before building

This requires the ability to [load data from previous executions](../../../../workflows/executions/debug/), which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.

If you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:

1. Create the sub-workflow and add the **Execute Sub-workflow Trigger**.
1. Set the node's **Input data mode** to **Accept all data** or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.
1. In the sub-workflow [settings](../../../../workflows/settings/), set **Save successful production executions** to **Save**.
1. Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.
1. Follow the steps to [load data from previous executions](../../../../workflows/executions/debug/).
1. Adjust the **Input data mode** to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.

You can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.

### Call the sub-workflow

1. Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.

1. Add the **Execute Sub-workflow** node.

1. In the **Execute Sub-workflow** node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.

Find your workflow ID

Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.

1. Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.

1. Save your workflow.

When your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.

You can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Sub-workflow node and selecting the **View sub-execution** link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.

## Templates and examples

[Browse Execute Sub-workflow Trigger integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/execute-workflow-trigger/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)

## How data passes between workflows

As an example, imagine you have an Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**. The Execute Sub-workflow node calls another workflow called **Workflow B**:

1. The Execute Sub-workflow node passes the data to the Execute Sub-workflow Trigger node (titled "When executed by another node" in the canvas) of **Workflow B**.
1. The last node of **Workflow B** sends the data back to the Execute Sub-workflow node in **Workflow A**.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.
1. Select the service you want to connect to.
1. Select your credential.

## Have a human fallback for AI workflows

**URL:** llms-txt#have-a-human-fallback-for-ai-workflows

**Contents:**
- Key features
- Using the example

This is a workflow that tries to answer user queries using the standard GPT-4 model. If it can't answer, it sends a message to Slack to ask for human help. It prompts the user to supply an email address.

This workflow uses the [Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) to provide the chat interface, and the [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) to call a second workflow that handles checking for email addresses and sending the Slack message.

[View workflow file](/_workflows/advanced-ai/examples/ask_a_human.json)

- [Chat Trigger](../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/): start your workflow and respond to user chat interactions. The node provides a customizable chat interface.
- [Agent](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): the key piece of the AI workflow. The Agent interacts with other components of the workflow and makes decisions about what tools to use.
- [Call n8n Workflow Tool](../../../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/): plug in n8n workflows as custom tools. In AI, a tool is an interface the AI can use to interact with the world (in this case, the data provided by your workflow). It allows the AI model to access information beyond its built-in dataset.

To load the template into your n8n instance:

1. Download the workflow JSON file.

**Contents:**
- Prerequisites
- Trigger configuration

Use this object to receive updates when your WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) changes. Refer to [Facebook Trigger](../) for more information on the trigger itself.

n8n recommends using the [WhatsApp Trigger node](../../n8n-nodes-base.whatsapptrigger/) with the [WhatsApp credentials](../../../credentials/whatsapp/) instead of the Facebook Trigger node. That trigger node includes twice the events to subscribe to.

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../../credentials/facebookapp/).

Examples and templates

For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Facebook Trigger integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/facebook-trigger/) page.

This Object requires some configuration in your app and WhatsApp account before you can use the trigger:

1. Subscribe your app under your WhatsApp business account. You must subscribe an app owned by your business. Apps shared with your business can't receive webhook notifications.
1. If you are working as a Solution Partner, make sure your app has completed App Review and requested the `whatsapp_business_management` permission.

## Trigger configuration

To configure the trigger with this Object:

1. Select the **Credential to connect with**. Select an existing or create a new [Facebook App credential](../../../credentials/facebookapp/).
1. Enter the **APP ID** of the app connected to your credential. Refer to the [Facebook App credential](../../../credentials/facebookapp/) documentation for more information.
1. Select **WhatsApp Business Account** as the **Object**.
1. **Field Names or IDs**: By default, the node will trigger on all the available events using the `*` wildcard filter. If you'd like to limit the events, use the `X` to remove the star and use the dropdown or an expression to select the updates you're interested in. Options include:
   - **Message Template Status Update**
   - **Phone Number Name Update**
   - **Phone Number Quality Update**
   - **Account Review Update**
   - **Account Update**

## Run your node locally

**URL:** llms-txt#run-your-node-locally

**Contents:**
  - Troubleshooting

You can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.

1. Install n8n using npm:

1. When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:

1. Install the node into your local n8n instance:

Make sure you run `npm link <node-name>` in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be:

- `~/.n8n/custom/`
   - `~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>`: if your n8n installation set a different name using `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`.

1. Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.

Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is `n8n-nodes-weather-nodes`, and the package contains nodes named `rain`, `sun`, `snow`, you should search for `rain`, not `weather-nodes`.

If there's no `custom` directory in `~/.n8n` local installation, you have to create `custom` directory manually and run `npm init`:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
npm install n8n -g
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
# In your node directory
   npm run build
   npm link
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
# In the nodes directory within your n8n installation
   # node-package-name is the name from the package.json
   npm link <node-package-name>
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
n8n start
```

## Remove Duplicates node

**URL:** llms-txt#remove-duplicates-node

**Contents:**
- Operation modes
  - Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input
  - Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions
  - Clear Deduplication History
- Templates and examples
- Related resources

Use the Remove Duplicates node to identify and delete items that are:

- identical across all fields or a subset of fields in a single execution
- identical to or surpassed by items seen in previous executions

This is helpful in situations where you can end up with duplicate data, such as a user creating multiple accounts, or a customer submitting the same order multiple times. When working with large datasets it becomes more difficult to spot and remove these items.

By comparing against data from previous executions, the Remove Duplicates node can delete items seen in earlier executions. It can also ensure that new items have a later date or a higher value than previous values.

Major changes in 1.64.0

The n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 1.64.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/7a66308290e6e5b104fcb82a3beafa0d6987df36/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates.md).

The remove duplication node works differently depending on the value of the **operation** parameter:

- **[Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input](#remove-items-repeated-within-current-input)**: Identify and remove duplicate items in the current input across all fields or a subset of fields.
- **[Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions](#remove-items-processed-in-previous-executions)**: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates.
- **[Clear Deduplication History](#clear-deduplication-history)**: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.

### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input

When you set the "Operations" field to **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input**, the Remove Duplicate node identifies and removes duplicate items in the current input. It can do this across all fields, or within a subset of fields.

#### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input parameters

When using the **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input** operation, the following parameter is available:

- **Compare**: Select which fields of the input data n8n should compare to check if they're the same. The following options are available:
  - **All Fields**: Compares all fields of the input data.
  - **All Fields Except**: Enter which input data fields n8n should exclude from the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.
  - **Selected Fields**: Enter which input data fields n8n should include in the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.

#### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input options

If you choose **All Fields Except** or **Selected Fields** as your compare type, you can add these options:

- **Disable Dot Notation**: Set whether to use dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child` (turned off) or not (turn on).
- **Remove Other Fields**: Set whether to remove any fields that aren't used in the comparison (turned on) or not (turned off).

### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions

When you set the "Operation" field to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**, the Remove Duplicate node compares items in the current input to items from previous executions.

#### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions parameters

When using the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation, the following parameters are available:

- **Keep Items Where**: Select how n8n decides which items to keep. The following options are available:

- **Value Is New**: n8n removes items if their value matches items from earlier executions.
  - **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**: n8n removes items if the current value isn't higher than previous values.
  - **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date**: n8n removes date items if the current date isn't later than previous dates.

- **Value to Dedupe On**: The input field or fields to compare. The option you select for the **Keep Items Where** parameter determines the exact format you need:

- When using **Value Is New**, this must be an input field or combination of fields with a unique ID.
  - When using **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**, this must be an input field or combination of fields that has an incremental value.
  - When using **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date**, this must be an input field that has a date value in ISO format.

#### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions options

When using the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation, the following option is available:

- **Scope**: Sets how n8n stores and uses the deduplication data for comparisons. The following options are available:
  - **Node**: (default) Stores the data for this node independently from other Remove Duplicates instances in the workflow. When you use this scope, you can [clear the duplication history](#clear-deduplication-history) for this node instance without affecting other nodes.
  - **Workflow**: Stores the duplication data at the workflow level. This shares duplication data with any other Remove Duplicate nodes set to use "workflow" scope. n8n will still manage the duplication data for other Remove Duplicate nodes set to "node" scope independently.

When you select **Value Is New** as your **Keep Items Where** choice, this option is also available:

- **History Size**: The number of items for n8n to store to track duplicates across executions. The value of the **Scope** option determines whether this history size is specific to this individual Remove Duplicate node instance or shared with other instances in the workflow. By default, n8n stores 10,000 items.

### Clear Deduplication History

When you set the "Operation" field to **Clear Deduplication History**, the Remove Duplicates node manages and clears the stored items from previous executions. This operation doesn't affect any items in the current input. Instead, it manages the database of items that the "Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions" operation uses.

#### Clear Deduplication History parameters

When using the **Clear Deduplication History** operation, the following parameter is available:

- **Mode**: How you want to manage the key / value items stored in the database. The following option is available:
  - **Clean Database**: Deletes all duplication data stored in the database. This resets the duplication database to its original state.

#### Clear Deduplication History options

When using the **Clear Deduplication History** operation, the following option is available:

- **Scope**: Sets the scope n8n uses when managing the duplication database.
  - **Node**: (default) Manages the duplication database specific to this Remove Duplicates node instance.
  - **Workflow**: Manages the duplication database shared by all Remove Duplicate node instances that use workflow scope.

## Workflow history

**URL:** llms-txt#workflow-history

**Contents:**
- Understand workflow history
- View workflow history
- Restore or copy previous versions

- Full workflow history is available on Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Self-hosted.
- Versions from the last five days are available for Cloud Pro users.
- Versions from the last 24 hours are available for registered Community users.

Use workflow history to view and restore previous versions of your workflows.

## Understand workflow history

n8n creates a new version when you:

- Save your workflow.
- Restore an old version. n8n saves the latest version before restoring.
- Pull from a Git repository using [Source control](../../source-control-environments/). Note that n8n saves versions to the instance database, not to Git.

Workflow history and execution history

Don't confuse workflow history with the [Workflow-level executions list](../executions/single-workflow-executions/).

Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to [Debug and re-run past executions](../executions/debug/) in your current workflow.

Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.

## View workflow history

To view a workflow's history:

1. Open the workflow.
1. Select **Workflow history** . n8n opens a menu showing the saved workflow versions, and a canvas with a preview of the selected version.

## Restore or copy previous versions

You can restore a previous workflow version, or make a copy of it:

1. On the version you want to restore or copy, select **Options** .
1. Choose what you want to do:
   - **Restore this version**: replace your current workflow with the selected version.
   - **Clone to new workflow**: create a new workflow based on the selected version.
   - **Open version in new tab**: open a second tab displaying the selected version. Use this to compare versions.
   - **Download**: download the version as JSON.

## Extract From File

**URL:** llms-txt#extract-from-file

**Contents:**
- Operations
- Example workflow
- Node parameters
  - Input Binary Field
  - Destination Output Field
- Templates and examples

A common pattern in n8n workflows is to receive a file, either from an [HTTP Request node](../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) (for files you are fetching from a website), a [Webhook Node](../n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) (for files which are sent to your workflow from elsewhere), or from a local source. Data obtained in this way is often in a binary format, for example a spreadsheet or PDF.

The Extract From File node extracts data from a binary format file and converts it to JSON, which can then be easily manipulated by the rest of your workflow. For converting JSON back into a binary file type, please see the [Convert to File](../n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) node.

Use the **Operations** drop-down to select the format of the source file to extract data from.

- **Extract From CSV**: The "Comma Separated Values" file type is commonly used for tabulated data.
- **Extract From HTML**: Extract fields from standard web page HTML format files.
- **Extract From JSON**: Extract JSON data from a binary file.
- **Extract From ICS**: Extract fields from iCalendar format files.
- **Extract From ODS**: Extract fields from ODS spreadsheet files.
- **Extract From PDF**: Extract fields from Portable Document Format files.
- **Extract From RTF**: Extract fields from Rich Text Format files.
- **Extract From Text File**: Extract fields from a standard text file format.
- **Extract From XLS**: Extract fields from a Microsoft Excel file (older format).
- **Extract From XLSX**: Extract fields from a Microsoft Excel file.
- **Move File to Base64 String**: Converts binary data to a text-friendly [base64](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-4) format.

In this example, a Webhook node is used to trigger the workflow. When a CSV file is sent to the webhook address, the file data is output and received by the Extract From File node.

[View workflow file](/_workflows/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/webhook-example.json)

Set to operate as 'Extract from CSV', the node then outputs the data as a series of JSON 'row' objects:

Receiving files with a webhook

Select the Webhook Node's **Add Options** button and select **Raw body**, then enable that setting to get the node to output the binary file that the subsequent node is expecting.

### Input Binary Field

Enter the name of the field from the node input data that contains the binary file. The default is 'data'.

### Destination Output Field

Enter the name of the field in the node output that will contain the extracted data.

This parameter is only available for these operations:
